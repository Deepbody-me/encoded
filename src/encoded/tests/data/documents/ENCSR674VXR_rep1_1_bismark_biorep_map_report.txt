===== bismark reference =====
Bismark report for: ENCFF357JNO_trimmed.fq and ENCFF631EWT_trimmed.fq (version: v0.15.0)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /home/dnanexus/input/ with the specified options: -q -N 1 -L 28 --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --minins 0 --maxins 500
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)
