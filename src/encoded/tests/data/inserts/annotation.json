    "description": "The DAC Blacklisted Regions aim to identify a comprehensive set of regions in the human genome that have anomalous, unstructured, high signal/read counts in next gen sequencing experiments independent of cell line and type of experiment. There were 80 open chromatin tracks (DNase and FAIRE datasets) and 20 ChIP-seq input/control tracks spanning ~60 human tissue types/cell lines in total used to identify these regions with signal artifacts. These regions tend to have a very high ratio of multi-mapping to unique mapping reads and high variance in mappability. Some of these regions overlap pathological repeat elements such as satellite, centromeric and telomeric repeats. However, simple mappability based filters do not account for most of these regions. Hence, it is recommended to use this blacklist alongside mappability filters. The DAC Blacklisted Regions track was generated for the ENCODE project.",
