    "description": "The roughly two meters of DNA in the human genome is intricately packaged to form the chromatin and chromosomes in each cell nucleus. In addition to its structural role, this organization has critical regulatory functions. In particular, the formation of loops in the human genome plays an essential role in regulating genes. We recently demonstrated the ability to create reliable maps of these loops, using an in situ Hi-C method for three-dimensional genome sequencing. Hi-C characterizes the three dimensional configuration of the genome by determining the frequency of physical contact between all pairs of loci, genome-wide. The proposed center will apply Hi-C and other new technologies to characterize genomic loops, their regulation, and their functions. We will specifically examine these structures in a wide variety of ENCODE cell types. The principles deduced from our study will be applicable to any mammalian tissue type.  Aim 1 will apply Hi-C to 80 cell types to generate maps of loops genome-wide. Aim 2 will combine Hi-C data with existing ENCODE data in order to identify the specific DNA elements responsible for establishing each loop. Aim 3 will share these datasets through our Juicebox data visualization system.   The proposed project will advance our understanding of the determinants and functions of chromatin loops, provide a critical reference of loop structures in the human and mouse genomes, and present a technological framework for comprehensive analysis of genome folding in any cell type. It will also form a basis for studying the contribution of 3D genome structure to human disease and development.",

    "description": "Efforts to map the functional elements of the human genome, which include elements such as insulators, enhancers, promoters and transcriptional start sites, have historically treated the genome as linear. However, it is now well appreciated that the genome has a three-dimensional (3D) organization that is important for mediating functional associations between regulatory elements and gene-coding sequences. Thus a linear map provides an incomplete picture of the genome, and it is often difficult or impossible to infer functional associations between regulatory elements without a topological framework to provide context. We have developed and advanced a powerful, high-resolution method for providing such a topological framework, Chromatin Interaction Analysis using Paired-End Tag sequencing (ChIA-PET). Using ChIA-PET, we have demonstrated that specific DNA motifs bound by CCCTC-binding Factor (CTCF) are critical in defining topological domains and arranging the gene positions for coordinated transcription mediated by RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII). Therefore, the combination of CTCF and RNAPII ChIA-PET will be effective for comprehensively mapping the major structure codes and topological organization that scaffold RNAPII- associated transcriptional regulation. We will contribute ChIA-PET technology to the ENCODE Project to both strengthen existing ENCODE datasets and identify new \u201cstructure code\u201d elements and their interplays with gene-coding sequences that will aid in understanding the transcriptional landscape of the genome. We have established a robust ChIA-PET pipeline from library production to data processing for human and mouse cells. Here, we propose to apply this platform to assay large numbers of cell lines and primary cells that represent a wide-range of cellular space with important biological significance. Based on our current production scale and estimated budget allocation, we aim to produce 1024 high quality datasets from CTCF and RNAPII ChIA-PET experiments, each with two biological replicates for 256 biological samples. This pipeline capacity will be applied to samples selected by the ENCODE Consortium, and to this sample pool we aim to contribute a collection of high value biological samples that are likely of common interest to both the Consortium and the greater research community. These samples include both primary and in vitro\u2013differentiated human blood cells, healthy and diseased induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), mature neurons differentiated from the iPSCs, and several major cell and tissue types from healthy and disease-model mice. These samples were selected to expand the \u201ccell space\u201d explored by the ENCODE Project and also because ChIA-PET analyses will be particularly relevant for revealing fundamental biology.",

    "description": "In multicellular organisms, differentiated cells exhibit specialized functions that are specified by distinct transcriptional and epigenetic programs. Differential use of regulatory elements defines most previously studied lineage specific gene expression programs. However, challenges such as stress, injury, or infection can elicit adaptive or pathogenic responses in differentiated cells leading to a change in their functional state and transcriptional output. Cells of the immune system offer a powerful experimental model for dissection of genomic mechanisms underlying establishment of distinct differentiation and activation states. In this proposal, we study distinct CD4+ T cell populations as they transition from \"na\u00bfve\" (or resting) to activated states with opposing function: effector T cells that promote - and activated regulatory T cells (Treg) that suppress - immune response and associated inflammation. Resting Treg cells emerge during differentiation as a stable lineage of T lymphocytes distinct from na\u00bfve CD4+ T cells. We will use sophisticated genetic mouse models to generate a short-term inflammatory disorder and investigate genomic features of activated Treg and T effector cells and their resting counterparts in an inflammatory context in vivo. We will profile the enhancer and transcriptional landscapes of the four cell states using DNase-seq, TF and histone modification ChIP-seq, and bulk and single-cell RNA-seq profiles from ex vivo isolated cells. Using these comprehensive data sets, we will: (1) decode the changes in the enhancer landscape that govern the activation of distinct CD4+ T lymphocyte populations; (2) model the differential transcriptional output of genes in these cells as a function of the sequence and activity of their enhancers; and (3) model the expression distribution of individual genes over a population of cells as a function of the state space of their enhancers. Given the central role that Treg cells play in suppressing immune-mediated inflammation in diverse biological contexts ranging from autoimmunity, injury, and infection to pregnancy and metabolic disease as well as emerging understanding of their pivotal role in cancer, our study has broad relevance to human health and major practical significance.",

We have recently developed a set of techniques that are based on the specific labeling of nascent RNA with bromouridine (Bru) followed by lysis, capturing of the Bru-labeled RNA using specific antibodies and deep sequencing. Bru-seq captures the nascent RNA transcriptome, a signature of ongoing transcription in the genome where the relative rates of transcription of all genes can be obtained. In BruChase-seq, cells are labeled with Bru and then chased in uridine for different periods of time to allow for the determination of the relative stability of all transcripts are assessed. Finally, BruUV-seq allows for the capturing of RNA species that normally are rapidly turned over by the RNA exosome and can be used to map active enhancer elements producing eRNA genome-wide. In this UM1 grant application we are proposing to use these three Bru-seq techniques to obtain critical novel information on the nascent RNA transcriptome, RNA stabilome and active enhancome that will complement and enrich existing ENCODE data. We are proposing to focus our mapping efforts on two specific Aims: Aim 1: Obtain nascent RNA transcriptome, RNA stabilome and active enhancome data for human and mouse ENCODE cell lines. Aim 2: Obtain dynamic signatures of nascent transcription, RNA stability and activity of enhancer elements genome-wide following cellular exposure to environmental perturbations. The mapping efforts proposed in this UM1 grant application are seeking to identify novel candidate regulatory elements genome-wide that will complement and extend existing ENCODE data. Furthermore, dynamic studies will be initiated to assess the activities of regulatory elements during selected cell transitions and specific cellular responses. GOALS: The main goal of this proposal is to generate comprehensive novel data sets using our newly developed Bru-seq analysis platform that will complement and extend existing ENCODE data. The emphasis will be on mapping candidate functional elements in the human genome.",

    "description": "The spatial organization of the genome impinges on all genomic processes, including gene regulation, maintenance of genome stability and chromosome transmission to daughter cells. A detailed understanding of the spatial arrangement of the human genome, referred to as the 4D nucleome, and the biological and physical principles that drive chromosome folding requires combining approaches from the fields of molecular and cell biology, imaging, genetics and genomics with approaches from physics, computational biology, and computer simulation. We have assembled a highly interdisciplinary center with the goal of generating extensively validated maps of the 4D nucleome, its physical and dynamic properties and its role in regulating the activity of the genome. First, the center will further optimize and extensively validate a suite of genome-wide molecular methodologies, based on chromosome conformation capture (3C) that can probe the folding of chromosomes at the scale of single nucleosomes, chromatin fibers, chromosomes and the entire nucleus, across cell populations and in single cells. Given that chromosome and nuclear organization is tightly linked to biological state of the cell, the center will map the 4D nucleome for four key biological states representing different conformations during the cell cycle (interphase and mitosis), and during cell differentiation (pluripotent and differentiated states). We will obtain complementary data regarding the structure and dynamics of chromatin, at different length scales and in single cells using extensive high-throughput imaging, live cell imaging and super resolution microscopy. Data obtained with all approaches will be analyzed, integrated and modeled using a set of methods we will further develop to gain insights into the structure, physics and dynamics of chromosome folding over different length scales. Finally, a critical component of our proposal is the biological validation and further elaboration of the chromatin interaction maps that are generated from our conformational analyses. This validation will be achieved through site-specific editing of genomic sequence and epigenetic marks, the creation of new contact points within the genome, and the identification of factors (both protein and nucleic acid) that facilitat or restrict these interactions. Effects of such perturbations in the chromosome conformation on transcription will reveal relationships between specific chromosome structural features and gene expression.",

    "description": "The goal of this project is to produce comprehensive, high-definition maps of mouse regulatory DNA marked by DNaseI hypersensitive sites to parallel the human catalogue currently under production by the ENCODE Project. Digital DNaseI technology enables efficient genome-wide mapping of accessible chromatin and DNaseI hypersensitive sites. The core regions of DNaseI hypersensitive sites are constitutively populated by regulatory factor binding sites, the nucleotide-resolution footprints of which may be systematically exposed on a genome-wide scale by ultra-deep sequencing. DNaseI hypersensitive sites exhibit marked cell-type variability; accordingly, production of a comprehensive catalog will require surveying a wide range of cell types. Cell types targeted under this proposal include murine analogues of the ENCODE Tier 1 and Tier 2 common reference cell lines; a broad spectrum of primary adult tissues; embryonic stem cells; and sentinel tissues amenable to sequential temporal profiling during development. The production of a parallel, high-quality, high-resolution compendium of mouse regulatory DNA will greatly enhance the value of the human ENCODE project and will provide a rich independent and unique resource for evolutionary, functional, and model organism genomics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance to Public Health Understanding the genetic basis of human disease requires detailed knowledge of the functional elements of the human genome which may be subject to polymorphism. The ENCODE Project seeks to identify all of the functional elements in the human genome, and present project seeks to greatly increase the value of the ENCODE data by providing a parallel catalogue of regulatory DNA in the mouse genome. This project is therefore expected to provide key insights into the importance of elements in the human genome, and to provide an unprecedented resource for rational functional modeling of human disease in the mouse.",

    "description": "While much progress has been made generating high quality chromatin state and accessibility data from the ENCODE and Roadmap consortia, accurately identifying cell-type specific enhancers from these data remains a significant challenge. We have recently developed a computational approach (gkmSVM) to predict regulatory elements from DNA sequence, and we have shown that when gkmSVM is trained on DHS data from each of the human and mouse ENCODE and Roadmap cells and tissues, it can predict both cell specific enhancer activity and the impact of regulatory variants (deltaSVM) with greater precision than alternative approaches. The gkmSVM model encapsulates a set of cell-type specific weights describing the regulatory binding site vocabulary controlling chromatin accessibility in each cell type. A striking observation is that the significant gkmSVM weights are generally identifiable with a small (~20) set of TF binding sites which vary by cell-type, consistent with the hypothesis that cell-type specific expression programs are controlled by a small set of core factors tightly coupled in mutually interacting regulatory circuits. Perturbations of these core regulators enable transitions between stable differentiated cell-type states of this genetic circuit. Here, we will use gkmSVM to systematically identify the core regulatory circuitry in all existing ENCODE and Roadmap human and mouse cell lines and tissues, and produce DNA sequence based genomic regulatory maps and fine-scale predictions of core regulator binding sites within predicted regulatory regions. We will generate binding site models for core regulators in each cell type, assess the accuracy of our predictions through direct experimental validation. The value of this map critically depends on its accuracy, so we demonstrate that gkmSVM predictions consistently outperform alternative methods in massively parallel enhancer reporter and luciferase validation assays, in blind community assessments of regulatory element predictions (CAGI), and in predicting validated causal disease associated variants. In contrast, we show that methods using PWM descriptions of TF binding sites are significantly less accurate. Finally, we will use our predictions of regulatory mutation impact to identify causal variants in GWAS and recently produced GTEx expression trait loci detected in a wide range of human tissues. Our regulatory maps will help design and inform focused experiments probing regulatory mechanisms, and aid in the interpretation of disease associated non-coding variants.",

The UCSC browser is a robust, flexible platform that integrates a variety of features that make accessing genomic data both convenient and information-rich. As such, it has attained a high level of acceptance throughout the biology, bioinformatics, and biomedical research communities. During the pilot phase of the ENCODE project, involving 1% of the genome, UCSC has been the repository of sequence-based data. Through participation in the pilot phase, we have established cost-effective, high-throughput approaches for incorporating and displaying ENCODE data, and we have developed an effective interface to the consortium for uploading data files and methods documentation to our FTP site. Through ongoing expansion and improvement of our ENCODE browser, we have laid the groundwork for data management in the whole-genome phase of the project. UCSC's specific aims for participation as the ENCODE DCC are as follows: 1) coordinate closely with the ENCODE data providers to collect, store, and manage ENCODE sequence-based functional element data and related metadata; 2) provide and maintain a long-term storage system for data from the ENCODE Consortium and related genomic projects; 3) provide the ENCODE and public research communities with freely-available mechanisms to access, search, and analyze the ENCODE data; 4) employ good software engineering practices to ensure that the ENCODE data are of the highest possible quality; and 5) foster collaboration with the biomedical community. Fundamental to understanding human biology and disease is the ability to identify and locate the functional elements in the human genome sequence. Both the effective presentation of experimental data and the ability to analyze sequence data using computational methods will help elucidate genomic function. Because the UCSC Genome Browser serves both of these purposes, it offers the ideal platform for ENCODE data.",

The majority of sequence variation identified in genome sequencing projects and disease association studies (GWAS) lie within the 98% of the human genome that is non-exomic. RegulomeDB is a unique web accessible resource that provides integrated knowledge of the wealth of existing information concerning regulatory elements that lie within non-exomic regions. The unique feature of this resource is its ability to comprehensively annotate, integrate and display the experimentally defined functional and biochemical regulatory elements of the human genome. Information generated from individual laboratories and consortia concerning potential regulatory regions such as that affecting gene expression, transcription factor binding, chromatin modification and DNA methylation will be collected from the literature, and integrated into a common database and displayed at nucleotide resolution. The information can be readily accessed via a web accessible interface and related to sequence variations identified from large scale projects (e.g. db SNPs, 1000 genome project, GWAS studies). Researchers will be able to compare variants identified from personal genomes and large scale sequencing projects as well as GWAS studies to the wealth of information in RegulomeDB, and thereby rapidly gain knowledge of non-exomic information. Given the wealth of DNA sequencing project that are emerging, we expect this unique resource to have wide impact in the biomedical community.",

To address this question a structural map of the 30 Mb of the ENCODE regions of human genomic DNA, at single-nucleotide resolution, has been produced, based on hydroxyl radical cleavage patterns of DNA. A freely available database, ORChID (OH Radical Cleavage Intensity Database), was constructed to house hydroxyl radical cleavage data. An algorithm was developed to predict the hydroxyl radical cleavage pattern of any DNA sequence to high accuracy. This algorithm was applied to the ENCODE regions of the human genome, and the resulting data were deposited in the UCSC genome browser. This dataset of DNA structural data can be searched for structural patterns in genomic DNA that may be associated with biological function. The first objective of this project is to develop high-throughput methods for collecting hydroxyl radical cleavage data, to enhance the predictive power of the ORChID database. The second objective is to locate structural features in human genomic DNA that are under selective evolutionary pressure, but for which the exact nucleotide sequence is not under selection. Experimental data production and informatics pipelines, data verification and validation protocols, and plans for data deposition are detailed in the application.",

    "description": "Genomes perform several critical tasks to ensure normal development, homeostasis and health. First, gene transcription needs to be accurately regulated and defects in gene regulation can result in human diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Second, chromosomes need to be replicated and then accurately and reliably transmitted to daughter cells. Chromosome segregation requires extensive chromosome compaction. Defects in this process can lead to genome instability, aneuploidy and cancer. Recent studies have revealed that the spatial organization of chromosomes is a major factor in controlling both gene expression and chromosome segregation. The work proposed here will for the first time characterize the three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of chromosomes during different stages of the cell cycle at unprecedented resolution which will allow the identification of cis-elements involved in the 3D folding of chromosomes. A set of novel and powerful genomic technologies (5C and Hi-C) that allow the mapping of 3D chromosome folding will be applied to the study of the human genome. These technologies will be combined with the use of synchronous cell populations and genome-wide analysis of regulatory elements to characterize the different chromosome conformations during the cell cycle and to identify the cis-elements and some trans-factors involved. In addition, the processes that determine 3D folding of the genome, such as transcription and modulation of DNA topology will be studied. This project will provide answers to long-standing questions related to long-range gene regulation, chromosome segregation, the epigenetic transmission of transcription profiles to daughter cells, and the still largely mysterious process of formation of compact metaphase chromosomes.",

    "description": "We propose to establish a Center for In Vivo Characterization of ENCODE Elements (CIViC) as part of ENCODE Phase 4. Understanding the function of the 98% of the human genome that is noncoding remains one of the most pressing challenges in genomics. The ENCODE Program has enabled major progress toward obtaining genome-wide molecular signatures associated with the human and mouse genome. During ENCODE3 our group contributed to the mapping of enhancer-associated marks, DNA methylation, and transcriptomes from multiple mouse tissues across closely spaced time points of embryogenesis, resulting in >750 datasets defining the in vivo epigenomic landscape during mammalian development. Our group has also characterized over 3,000 candidate enhancer sequences in transgenic mouse assays, including more than 400 through our participation in ENCODE2 and ENCODE3. Despite this progress, enhancers are only one of many noncoding molecular functions that have been inferred from ENCODE data. Other major proposed categories of noncoding sequences identified through ENCODE and other publicly available data sets include DNA elements with predicted functions, such as \u201csuper-enhancers\u201d (very large enhancers with possibly distinct functions) or chromatin domain boundary elements. They also include sequence classes of unknown function primarily defined by specific assays, such as differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The functional impact of these different classes of noncoding sequences on organismal biology and human health remains minimally explored, representing a major limitation of the ENCODE encyclopedia. The Center for In Vivo Characterization of ENCODE Elements will use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to systematically explore the biological significance of several classes of noncoding function based on ENCODE3 data. Leveraging the streamlined set of mouse engineering tools available in our laboratory, we will: 1. Perform integrative analysis of ENCODE3 and complementary data sets to identify and prioritize representative sequences from 3 different classes of noncoding elements (enhancers and super-enhancers, boundary elements, DMRs); 2. Systematically delete a total of 48 representative sequences in mice and perform RNA-seq and gross organismal phenotyping to understand the in vivo consequences of these deletions; 3. Continue to make transgenic enhancer characterization capabilities available to ENCODE investigators to validate and calibrate enhancer prediction methods. We will also use transgenics and CRISPR knock-in editing to test human disease-associated alleles of ENCODE-predicted enhancer elements. All efforts will be closely coordinated with other ENCODE4 functional characterization groups to focus on common sets of elements to be characterized using the full ENCODE-wide arsenal of in vitro and in vivo characterization methods. Our results will provide an understanding of the in vivo significance of different classes of noncoding elements and thereby substantially increase the value of the ENCODE encyclopedia.",

    "description": "Our primary goal is to comprehensively identify the functional transcribed sequences, both protein coding and non-protein coding in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. We will provide a description of the complete gene structures with transcription start sites, polyadenylation sites, and all detectable alternative transcripts. We plan to survey representative time points throughout development, a wide-variety of tissue types and well-characterized and novel cell lines. RNAs from these samples will be used for high-resolution expression profiling of the transcriptome using whole-genome tiling arrays, RNA ligase mediated Rapid Amplification of cDNA ends, RT-PCR and cDNA library construction. RT-PCR will be used to identify and isolate transcripts for rarely expressed genes of small to medium size. The cDNA libraries will be screened using a targeted approach to identify and isolate medium to large transcripts. Characterization of small RNAs (<100 bp) requires innovative strategies and we will use high-resolution (5bp) whole-genome tiling arrays and 454 sequencing. Concurrent with these studies will be a bioinformatic analysis to identify novel unannotated genes that for the first time utilizes algorithms that synthesize expression, comparative sequence and gene prediction. Further, we plan to characterize and annotate the extent of splice variation used to generate protein isoforms and identify the sequences necessary for regulated alternative splicing utilizing in vivo splicing reporter assays, RNAi and computational analysis. Finally, ncRNAs will be validated using in vivo tissue culture assays for expression and function. The scope of these studies is unprecedented and will provide the most comprehensive set of experimental evidence of transcription for any organism. As a public resource, these studies are a prerequisite for understanding normal growth and differentiation and that will aid in understanding these processes in other organisms, including humans. Drosophila models have been developed for Alzheimers, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. In addition, genes first identified to play a role in Drosophila development are often components of conserved regulatory networks that play important roles during animal development and have been found, in humans, to contribute to the development of a variety of human cancers.",

    "description": "Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into chromatin, which regulates the function of proteins that mediate transcriptional activity and other essential processes, including recombination and the faithful segregation of the genome during mitosis and meiosis. The goal of this proposal is to identify discrete elements that regulate chromatin structure and function in the nematode C. elegans, a model metazoan of central importance in large-scale genomic research and gene function discovery. We will first use ChlP-chip and related methods to map the genomic distributions of selected histone modifications and chromosome-associated proteins, and then use that information, in combination with data from other modENCODE groups, to build quantitative models of chromatin function. Specifically, we will: 1. Identify and technically validate functional elements that control chromatin and chromosome behavior. The focus of our analysis will be elements that specify nucleosome positioning and occupancy, control domains of gene expression, induce repression of the X chromosome, guide mitotic segregation and genome duplication, govern homolog pairing and recombination during meiosis, and organize chromosome positioning within the nucleus. 126 strategically selected targets include key histone modifications, histone variants, RNA polymerase II isoforms, dosage-compensation proteins, centromere components, homolog-pairing facilitators, recombination markers, and nuclear-envelope constituents. An efficient pipeline design will facilitate identification and validation of the different classes of functional elements associated with these targets and will integrate the results with the well-annotated C. elegans genome. 2. Biologically validate identified functional elements and build integrated, quantitative models of chromosome function. We will integrate information generated in Aim 1 with existing knowledge on the biology of the targets, perform ChlP-chip analysis on mutant and RNAi extracts lacking selected target proteins, use extrachromosomal arrays to assess the ability of candidate identified sequence motifs to recruit targets in vivo, identify tissue-specific patterns of selected targets, and create integrated, quantitative models of transcription and whole-chromosome functions. Achieving these goals in the context of the ongoing expansion and rich history of C. elegans research will provide an important milestone in meeting the challenge of using genome sequence information to understand and predict biological functions.",

    "description": "Our goal is to discover and use relationships between mouse and human regulatory genomes to advance the ENCODE Project in its effort to map all functional elements in the human genome. Our comparative approach aims to uncover principles and solve problems that are proving difficult by studying the human genome alone. ENCODE is vigorously mapping hundreds of function-associated biochemical markers in selected cell lines, resulting already in tens of millions of reproducible biochemical features. Some observed protein:DNA interactions find and refine known transcriptional enhancers, promoters, silencers, together with associated chromatin structure, as was anticipated. But substantial questions arise as to how many of the myriad biochemical events are functional, what those functions are, which gene or genes are meaningful targets, etc. To highlight and sort functionally important biochemical marks from others, we will systematically identify the molecular events retained by both mouse and human since they diverged. We will then analyze how conservation of biochemical features relates to conservation of DNA sequence and conservation of regulated gene expression. By using the mouse, we can leverage decades of molecular genetics and manipulated mouse genomes that do not exist in any other mammal. In Aim 1 we execute genome-wide assays for biochemical signatures of functional DNA sequences in a few specific mouse cell types. By using well-studied mouse lines and cell states, we can interpret results in light of previously validated elements and in light of ENCODE human results. We will use ENCODE standards for high throughput, sequence-based assays to determine gene expression, DNase hypersensitive sites, histone modifications and selected transcription factor occupancy in seven mouse cell types. The eight selected features are the most informative ones for function, and thus most useful for comparison with human data. In Aim 2, we apply a genome-wide implementation of chromosome conformation capture to map the interactions between transcription factor binding sites and their responsive genes in two cell types. These results will be compared to those from an ENCODE developmental project. Comparative analysis in Aim 3 will insure that the impact of the data we produce will go beyond the individual mouse cell systems per se. To do this we have organized a collaboration of investigators at multiple institutions, in which each group is expert in one or more critical aspects. Our data, made public and accessible via ENCODE, will fuel and accelerate many future studies after the 2-yr stimulus both in and beyond ENCODE. This responds to NHGRI request for applications on \"Enhancement of the value of the human ENCODE Project by conducting a parallel effort on the mouse genome.\" The proposed work will improve the maps of biologically functional DNA sequences in humans, which in turn will help explain how variants in human genome sequences could be associated with human diseases, leading to candidates for novel avenues for effective therapy and prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every person differs in his or her response to pathogens and in the likelihood that they will suffer from complex diseases such as cancer, heart disease or diabetes. Individual susceptibility to disease is determined in part by genetics, and we can map with high precision the locations of DNA variants associated with disease susceptibility. In order to understand how these variants contribute to disease susceptibility, we need to identify the biological functions of all DNA sequences; the proposed work will help us map these functional DNA sequences.",

    "description": "The analysis of individual parts of the genome enables a more comprehensive understanding of how the parts fit together in the broader context of disease. The following projects build on my previous work and utilize integrative analyses of genomic datasets to address the genome as a complex regulatory system. Update of research projects on individual functional elements and community impact. Exon Skipping. My work to identify sequence mutations that cause exon skipping (Woolfe et al. 2010) applied statistical tests to determine which features showed statistically significant, predictive ability to discriminate neutral variants from disease-causing mutations. We implemented the results in a web server that evaluates variants of Unknown function to predict those most likely to cause exon skipping, Skippy, (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/skippy/), which continues to receive the most visits of all NHGRI webservers and downloads for private use. Recent work in my lab, using the Skippy web server to prioritize all known synonymous substitutions in the CFTR gene, identified two uncharacterized variants that cause exon skipping and are likely to contribute to cases of cystic fibrosis (Scott et al. 2012). Recent applications of this software by other groups include the identification and functional characterization of 11 novel PLP1 mutations involved in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease and spastic paraplegia type 2 (Grossi et al. 2011), in prioritization of mutations detected in the COL4A1 gene involved in Walker-Warburg Syndrome in humans (Labelle-Dumais 2011), in evaluation of mutations involved in risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (Bronson et al 2011), and in diseases important to cattle breeding strategies (Gargani et al. 2011). Negative regulatory elements. My group developed the first, systematic expression vector system to experimentally assay negative regulatory elements (Petrykowska et al. 2008). Despite the commonly held hypothesis that negative cis-acting elements are present in the human genome, examples have not been widely defined or characterized. My research to help identify negative elements has broader importance because mutations in these elements would be activating for disease and could play a role in a host of diseases. Annotations of NRE discovered by my group are posted on the UCSC Human Genome Browser test web site (http://genome-test.cse.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?hgsid=2890633&c=chr4&g=wgEncodeNhgriNre). Since inception of the assay, I have provided the vectors as source materials to the community and continue to collaborate with other labs upon request. Furthermore, I have participated in the ENCODE Consortium analysis groups to experimentally assess the functional activity of putative negative regulatory elements predicted in genomic sequences (ENCODE Consortium et al. 2011 and ENCODE Consortium et al. 2012). New promoter elements. With the objective of identifying new regulatory components in promoters, my group examined mutation data in the Ankyrin-1 (ANK-1) promoter of a patient with ankyrin-deficient Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS), and showed that a novel mutation disrupted the binding of the transcription factor TFIID (Yang et al. 2011, LaFlamme et al. 2010). We hypothesized that the underlying sequence represented a novel promoter element used in promoters of additional genes. We examined 17,181 human promoters for the experimentally validated binding site, called the TFIID localization sequence (DLS) and found three times as many promoters containing the DLS motif than TATA motifs. The region of enrichment was localized to a window of 150 bp upstream to 250 bp downstream of the transcription start site in a profile similar but distinct from the TFIIB Recognition Element (BRE). Mutational analyses of DLS sequences in promoters of randomly chosen genes confirmed the functional significance of the DLS, and addition of a DLS to an SP1 site indicated the combination was sufficient to confer basal promoter activity. The results demonstrate that novel promoter elements can be identified on a genome-wide scale through observations of regulatory disruptions that cause human disease. Projects to integrate multiple functional aspects into disease interpretation. Address the evolution of the human genome through the emergence of new human-specific genes regulated by bidirectional promoters. Research from my group previously established the enrichment of bidirectional promoters in vertebrate genomes including human, mouse, rat, and cow (Yang et al, 2008), which indicates evolutionary selection to maintain their presence. Despite the cross-species similarities, we discovered that some bidirectional promoters correspond to positions of unidirectional promoters in other vertebrate species; leading to the hypothesis that species-specific bidirectional promoters greatly and uniquely target the detection of species-specific transcripts in any genome. We confirmed this hypothesis while participating in the Bovine Genome Consortium (Bovine Sequencing Consortium et al. 2009) and identified a spliced, highly expressed, multi-exon (noncoding) transcript regulated by a bidirectional promoter that was exclusive to the bovine lineage (Piontkivska et al. 2009). To find human-specific transcripts, my group identified a set of 1,400 nonconserved, novel noncoding transcripts flanking bidirectional promoters (Gotea et al. 2012, submitted). Once identified, we tested the transcripts for signs of positive selection, as an indicator of beneficial function to the human genome. After integrating computational and experimental data, we found nucleotide substitutions that facilitate the emergence of new exons in those genes. The gene list provides the basis for understanding novel transcripts that are present only in the human genome. Moreover, using this approach, transcripts can be identified that are unique to any species. Data from this project has been submitted for publication. Compare genome-wide methylation patterns in subtypes of ovarian tumors. I am testing the hypothesis that altered DNA methylation in promoter regions can distinguish genes that are relevant to ovarian tumor pathology. Given the sporadic nature of 90% of ovarian cancers, disruption of normal gene regulation is a likely contributor to disease etiology. Methylation patterns at 25,475 unique loci in 43 samples of ovarian, endometrial or metastatic tumors, along with normal fallopian tube and normal endometrium were assessed. Data from this project showed that methylation patterns mirrored histopathological subdivisions of ovarian tumors and discriminated tumor types with finer granularity and greater reproducibility than published gene expression assays (Kolbe at al. 2012). The extensive differences we showed between tumor and normal samples are the first report of a methylator phenotype in ovarian endometrioid tumors, analogous to the methylator phenotype identified in colorectal cancer and glioblastoma. Ongoing studies will be to look for biomarkers for use in diagnostic tests.",

    "description": "Our understanding of post-transcriptional regulation is comparatively poor, with only a handful of regulatory elements that direct post-transcriptional control being experimentally characterized. Eukaryotic organisms depend on the actions of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) for successful post-transcriptional control gene expression and they provide the link between transcriptional and translational regulation, playing essential roles in many regulatory processes including transcription, splicing, export, stability and translation. The comprehensive identification of cis-regulatory elements residing in expressed RNA is fundamental to the NIH/NHGRI ENCODE project but is extremely limited at the present time. Previously we developed methods for purifying endogenous RBP-RNA complexes and identifying the associated RNA targets using whole genome expression array technologies (termed ribonomics). This advance enabled the large-scale identification of many mRNA targets of RBPs and provided new insight into the principles governing posttranscriptional gene regulation. Our studies demonstrated that, analogous to transcriptional regulation, groups of functionally related RNAs are coordinately regulated in a combinatorial manner by distinct classes of RBPs by targeting related cis-regulatory elements located in the transcripts. As part of an earlier ENCODE technology grant, we improved our technology by developing a RIP-Chip tiling-array based assay that incorporates a digestion step to facilitate the identification of targeted cis-regulatory elements/RBPbinding sites. Using this method, the objective of this project is to comprehensively catalog the cis regulatory elements/RBP-binding sites CREBS present in expressed ENCODE mRNA using the five ENCODE cell lines and several cellular perturbations. This will be accomplished by (1) characterizing the genome-wide associations of expressed mRNA with a set of representative set of RBPs using ribonomic profiling and whole-genome expression arrays; (2) identifying the CREBS of the subset of ENCODE expressed mRNAs using tiling-array based RIP-Chip; (3) verifying and further increasing the resolution of predicted ENCODE cis-regulatory elements/RBP-binding sites using bioinformatics followed by quantitative Real-Time PCR and (4) biologically validating the function and RBP-binding activity of identified CREBS using a reporter assay. ln summary, we will use RNA-binding proteins to identify RNA based cis-regulatory elements / RBP-binding sites in the ENCODE sequence of the human genome.",

    "description": "Our long-term objective is to elucidate networks of eukaryotic small RNAs and their regulatory targets. We are motivated in this endeavor by the growing body of evidence that demonstrates fundamental cellular activities for diverse classes of RNAs in the 20-30 nucleotide range. One class that has received particular attention are the microRNAs, an abundant family of -22 nucleotide inhibitory RNAs that derive from hairpin precursor transcripts. It is estimated that there at least one thousand human microRNAs, which collectively regulate at least 30% of human genes. Additional classes of processed small RNAs include endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), repeat associated siRNAs, and Piwi-associated RNAs. We propose herein a focused set of experimental and computational experiments to characterize the small RNA component of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. (1) We will perform high-throughput pyrosequencing of a broad variety of libraries to obtain comprehensive coverage of expressed Drosophila small RNAs. (2) We will exploit the recent availability of a dozen sequenced fly genomes to make highly specific computational predictions of microRNA genes and microRNA targets in silico. (3) We will use microarray profiling and other molecular techniques to validate the endogenous expression of microRNAs and other novel small RNA genes. We will also perform in vivo phenotypic assays to demonstrate their biological activity. (4) We will elucidate the structures of primary microRNA transcripts by genetically stabilizing these transient species, followed by genome tiling microarray analysis. This work will culminate in a thorough annotation of the different classes of processed small RNAs and their associated precursor transcripts in Drosophila. Going beyond Drosophila, it is well documented that misregulation of small RNA pathways has tremendous adverse consequences for the development and physiology of all eukaryotic species. This comprehensive effort to uncover small RNA genes in flies will not only inform the annotation of small RNA genes in the human genome, but also lay the foundation for future studies of their normal and pathological roles. Insights gained from this genetically tractable model organism will be relevant for understanding the functional contributions of small RNAs to human disease.",

A comprehensive set of regulatory events across a genome - the regulome - is needed to make full use of genomic information, but is currently out of reach for practically all clinical applications and many biological systems The proposed Center will develop technologies that greatly increase the sensitivity, speed, and comprehensiveness of understanding genome regulation. We will develop new technologies to interrogate the transactions between the genome and regulatory factors, such as proteins and noncoding RNAs, and integrate variations in DNA sequences and chromatin states over time and across individuals. Novel molecular engineering and biosensor strategies are deployed to encapsulate the desired complex DNA transformations into the probe system, such that the probe system can be directly used on very small human clinical samples and capture genome-wide information in one or two steps. These technologies will be applied to clinical samples and workflows in real time to exercise their robustness and reveal for the first time epigenomic dynamics of human diseases during progression and treatment. These technologies will be broadly applicable to many biomedical investigations, and the Center will disseminate the technologies via training and diverse means.",

    "description": "The overall aim of this proposal is to establish a comprehensive, high-quality catalogue of human DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs) spanning all major tissue lineages. We plan to map DNaseI hypersensitive sites at physiological resolution across the genome with high sensitivity and specificity. The major focus of our production effort will be on data quality, a strategy that served the Human Genome Project well. Accordingly, samples will be rigorously screened in a pipeline fashion, with only a select set advancing to whole-genome data collection (Specific Aim 1). To ensure the broadest possible coverage of both unique and non-unique genomic territories, a synergistic combination of three technologies (DNase-array, digital mapping of DNAasel cleave site sequences, and Quantitative Chromatin Profiling) will be applied (Specific Aim 2). This combination will enable mapping of >95% of the DHSs in the genome of each cell type. Independent validation provides the ultimate quality standard. We therefore plan to validate the DHS catalogue in a statistically rigorous fashion using hypersensitivity Southerns, a well-established, gold standard assay (Specific Aim 3). Since DNAasel hypersensitive sites are generic markers of a broad spectrum of human cis-regulatory sequences, the utility of the catalogue will be greatly enhanced by the classification of DHSs into major functional categories including promoters, distal elements (enhancers, LCRs), and insulators (Specific Aim 4). Validation of DHS functional classes will be accomplished using well-tested cell and transgenic assays of biological function (Specific Aim 5).",

    "description": "There is a fundamental gap in understanding how the millions of known regulatory elements functionally contribute to gene regulation and phenotypes. Continued existence of that gap is an important problem because, until it is filled, it will remain extremely difficult to identify the genetic mechanisms underlying the thousands of observed genetic associations with disease phenotypes. Our long-term goal is to understand how and to what extent gene regulatory elements alter target gene expression and impact phenotypes. The objectives of this particular proposal are to functionally characterize all regulatory elements contributing to the differentiation of CD4+ T cells. In doing so, we will identify the causal regulatory mechanisms that modulate the immune system. The rationale for this work is that understanding those mechanisms will be the foundation for future efforts to therapeutically modulate the immune system, and will establish a discovery platform for determining the mechanisms underlying countless other model systems. Specifically, we will characterize three complementary components of regulatory element activity: (i) the capacity of regulatory elements to drive expression of a reporter gene, (ii) the effect of each regulatory element on the expression of one or more target genes, and (iii) the contributions of regulatory elements to phenotypic function, namely differentiation. We will accomplish those goals across three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will quantify the activity of all regulatory elements that have evidence of differential activity between subtypes of mouse CD4 T cells. We will do so using a capture-based high-throughput reporter assay that allows us to assay larger (>500 bp) fragments from specific genomic regions of interest. In Aim 2, we will quantify the effects of regulatory elements on target genes using a novel strategy that combines high-throughput CRISPR/ Cas9-based epigenome editing screens and targeted high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing. In Aim 3, we will determine which regulatory elements are necessary or sufficient for CD4 T cell differentiation using high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9-based epigenome-editing screens combined differentiation into particular CD4 T cell subtypes. Each aim will provide functional characterization of all of the regulatory elements implicated in CD4 T cell differentiation. Together, the aims will provide a comprehensive, multi-layered, and systematic understanding of the ways that gene regulatory elements modulate the immune system. The result will be an actionable set of targets for designing strategies to modulate immune system activity for therapeutic benefit. Because the approach is general to any model system, the same strategy can be readily transferred to diverse systems including differentiation and disease models. Therefore, we expect that this project will have both immediate and long-term benefit for determining the ways that regulatory elements contribute to health and disease.",

    "description": "We propose to work cooperatively with other Mapping Centers and the Data Coordination Center (EDACC) funded by this Roadmap mechanism to comprehensively map epigenomes of select human cells with significant relevance to complex human disease. Our group, consisting of scientists at UCSF, UC Davis, UCSC and the British Columbia Genome Sciences Centre has the broad expertise that this project requires. We will focus on cells relevant to human health and complex disease including cells from the blood, brain, breast and U.S. Government-approved lines of human embryonic stem cells (aim 1). We will incorporate high quality, homogeneous cells from males and females, and two predominant racial groups, and biological replicates of each cell type. Production of comprehensive maps will include 6 histone modifications selected for their opposing roles in regulating active and inactive chromatin (aim 2), DNA methylation (aim 3) and miRNA and gene expression (aim 4). This epigenetic data, along with genetic and expression data will be integrated using advanced informatics (aim 5) to address fundamental roles of epigenetics in differentiation, maintenance of cell-type identity and gene expression. Our cell and data production pipeline will incorporate verification and data validation with independent methods, and will operate under a model motivated by increased data production and decrease cost. We summarize the analysis capacity of our instruments and our explicit strategy for data sharing of our proposed REMC-generated resources including biological specimens, protocols, data, software tools and intellectual resources. We envision that our group in conjunction with the other REMC teams, the EDACC, ENCODE, future EHHD (Epigenetics of Human Health and Disease) centers and the NIH Roadmap program will develop methods, tools and reference epigenome maps for the research community that will make the promise of epigenetics in understand and treating human complex disease a reality. Our reference epigenomes will enable new disciplines including human population epigenetics, comparative epigenomics, neuroepigenetics, and therapeutic epigenetics for tissue regeneration and reversal of disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epigenome is the dynamic interface between our changing environment and the static genome, and understanding it is a goal of immense importance to human health. We will map reference cell epigenomes of the brain, breast, blood and approved embryonic stem cells, inclusive of males and females and different racial groups. This cooperative work will transform our understanding of the short and long-lasting consequences of environment impact on human health and disease.",

    "description": "Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease.",

    "description": "The human genome is regulated by hundreds of thousands of functional DNA elements that play pivotal roles in development and disease, yet remain poorly understood. Comprehensive identification and characterization of functional DNA elements is thus an essential goal with major implications for human health. Genomic DNA is organized into chromatin, a higher-order structure composed of DNA, RNA and proteins. Chromatin mapping technologies have emerged as a powerful means for identifying functional DNA elements, which are associated with characteristic chromatin structures. Mapping has enabled the systematic annotation of diverse types of functional elements, including promoters, enhancers and silencers, and new discoveries related to chromatin organization and genome regulation in health and disease. The proposed ENCODE data production center aims to vastly expand the catalog of functional elements in the human genome through production mapping of Protein, DNA and RNA constituents of chromatin. High-throughput pipelines will be used to map histone modifications, chromatin regulatory proteins and non-coding RNA binding interactions. These pipelines will be applied to designated ENCODE cell lines, embryonic stem (ES) cells and derivatives, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and phenotypically diverse human tissues. Key histone modifications will also be mapped in representative cell and tissue types from multiple individuals, in order to address the extent and significance of inter-individual variation in chromatin landscapes and their relationships to genetic background. These multi-dimensional datasets will be integrated through innovative computational algorithms to identify sequences, motifs, variants and regulatory interactions that dictate chromatin state and functional element activity. Thus, the proposed project will dramatically increase the number, resolution and precision of functional DNA elements in the ENCODE catalog, and explicitly define causal sequences and physical interactions that mediate chromatin states and regulation in the human genome. All data will be rapidly released and made freely available to the scientific community.",

    "description": "Almost a tenth of human genes code for proteins that interact with chromosomes in the nucleus. Most of these DNA-associated proteins (referred to as DAPs) are involved in regulating the expression of genes, by serving as part of the basic transcriptional machinery, as transcription factors that regulate the spatial and temporal levels of transcription, or as chromatin state regulators. These proteins are key components in biology, as transcriptional regulation underlies fundamental biological processes in organismal development, in determining cell states during differentiation, and in directing physiological responses to the internal and external environment. Thus, comprehensive and detailed assessment of the molecular actions of DAPs, that is, where they interact throughout the human genome, is a fundamental long-term goal of both basic and clinical research. In response to RFA-HG-16-002, \u201cExpanding the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) in the Human and Mouse (UM1)\u201d, this application proposes to use a recently-established \"shovel ready\" pipeline for mapping DAPs in human cell lines that overcomes the very high failure rates of traditional ChIP-seq, a widely- used approach that requires specific antibodies for each factor. The new approach, called CETCh-seq, involves adding an epitope tag at the endogenous locus encoding each protein, and using chromatin immunoprecipitation with a universal antibody against the epitope followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify DAP-DNA associations genome-wide. This production pipeline will be applied to each of 1,244 DAPs that are expressed in a set of human cell lines and have not yet been mapped by ENCODE. During the four-year project, this pipeline will be used to test each of these factors in one human cell line, and for 100 of the DAPs, in four human cell lines, allowing characterization of cell-type differences. The project will also tag and assay multiple allelic versions of a small number of DAPs in which pathogenic or potentially pathogenic mutations have been identified. The project will produce genome-wide DAP maps and identify motifs for hundreds of human regulatory proteins, providing an important component for the next phase of the ENCODE Project. All data, as well as useful materials in the form of gene editing plasmids and tagged human cell lines, will be made freely available to the research community.",

    "description": "The modeling of transcription to genome proximal elements to date has revealed associations, but seldom are disruptions performed to confirm mechanistic possibilities and substantiate causality. In studying multistate cell systems, many processes important to human health are difficult to study due to low cell availability and/or dyssynchrony leading to heterogeneous cell populations. We propose to study a model of the human epidermal differentiation system, which by its intrinsic properties does not have these problems but at the same time closely simulates the native process. We plan to perform multiple next generation sequencing modalities of transcription and gene proximal components over a time course spanning the transition from progenitor to differentiated keratinocytes. A network based on boosting methods and dynamic Bayesian networks will then be generated to model transcription to the gene proximal components, and this construct will be tested with various regulatory disruptions. Moreover, additional assays of transcription and gene proximal components will be performed during intervals which the model suggests will be particularly illuminating for epidermal differentiation. With these new data, the model will be further refined, and this cycle will be repeated multiple times. Because of the tractability of our experimental system to a vast array of sequencing assays and regulatory disruptions, we will be able to achieve an understanding of how much each assay contributes to the predictive accuracy of our model. In this way, our results will have implications not only for skin biology and hundreds of skin disorders but also for network modeling of transcriptional regulation in general.",

    "description": "We propose to continue a multidisciplinary project to understand the mechanisms by which aberrant, unusual, or foreign RNA and DNA structures trigger gene silencing. The major aims of this project are: 1. Establish the mechanisms by which miRNA, siRNA, and piRNA effectors repress their genetic targets. Thirty years of careful molecular-genetic analysis of developmental progression in C. elegans, combined with new technologies for genome editing, provide a remarkable ability to make targeted changes \"in place\" in genomic contexts that will allow us to address specific physiological regulatory mechanisms in vivo. Adding the intensive genetic analysis of small RNA targeting machineries that has been performed in C. elegans yields a platform to definitively assign silencing mechanisms for each of the major small RNA regulatory classes. Assigning these mechanisms should provide important guidance in understanding small RNA-based effects on physiology and disease and in applying small RNAs as modulators in experimental and therapeutic contexts. 2. Investigate mechanisms used by organisms to recognize and silence foreign DNA. Along with an ability to recognize and target foreign or aberrant RNA, cells have sets of mechanisms to recognize and silence foreign DNA molecules introduced by injection or other routes. In some aspects, such mechanisms overlap with known foreign RNA defense mechanisms, while certain features of the foreign DNA response are not easily explained by current RNA-based silencing models. We will analyze a set of non-cannonical triggering events and downstream silencing processes with the long term goals of understanding DNA-triggered silencing mechanisms, being able to defeat these mechanisms for specific experimental or therapeutic goals that involve expression of foreign DNA, and of being able to co-opt DNA silencing as needed to flexibly block specific gene expression. 3. Investigate the mechanisms by which new small RNA effector repertoire is acquired by the genome. Genomic regions encoding small RNA effectors show a remarkably dynamic character, allowing acquisition of new silencing capabilities and thus protection against novel invasive agents as appropriate specificities are added to the repertoire. Little is known about how new small RNA repertoire is added, with recent technical advances in sequence analysis allowing these questions to be addressed both on a structural level (what structures give rise to new elements of the repertoire) and on a functional level (how new sequence acquisitions are executed). Understanding of RNA repertoire acquisition will be of considerable value, (i) in guiding our views on the role and capabilities dynamic small RNA regulatory systems, (ii) in illuminating any conditions resulting from inability to adapt and thus respond to novel pathogens, and (iii) in providing a potential entry into using the system for directed repertoire expansion to provide experimental or therapeutic intervention.",

These RNA elements, when expressed, form the basis of co- and post-transcriptional regulation of human genes. Our strategy consists of developing and integrating a physical map of 300 RBPs in two different human cell lines with transcriptome-wide measurements of the effects of depleting these RBPs, their localization patterns and their binding preferences independent of co-factor associations. Over the past 4 years, our consortium (Burge, Graveley, Lecuyer and Yeo) has established highly efficient data production workflows of experimental methods (RNA bind-n-seq, RNA-seq, Localization and enhanced CLIP) that will enable us to immediately expand these datasets, which form a crucial and missing link to decipher the mechanisms of post-trancriptional regulation and how these impact genetic variation and disease etiology. When combined with the data we generated over the past four years, these efforts will culminate in a comprehensive map of the functional RNA elements recognized by essentially all RBPs expressed in two human cell lines, representing approximately half of the known complement of human RBPs. ENCORE will (1) generate and validate a physical resource of cell lines expressing epitope-tagged RBPs, (2) develop transcriptomics and imaging databases of these RBPs to provide simple interfaces for the community to mine this resource, (3) develop and distribute workflows for integrative analyses and shareable results from these workflows and (4) provide training and outreach to establish ENCORE annotations as the standard reference for co- and post-transcriptional research and clinical genomics efforts in the long-term.",

    "description": "The goals of the ENCODE Data Coordinating Center (DCC) is to support the ENCODE Consortium by defining and establishing a strategy that connects all participants to the data and by creating avenues of access that distribute these data to the greater biological research community. The ENCODE Consortium brings together laboratories that generate complex data types via experimental assays with laboratories that integrate these unique data using computational analyses to discover how chromosomal elements function together to define human cells and tissues. The DCC's participation enhances the data created by these laboratories through the creation of structured procedures for the verification and validation of all submitted data and providing processes for the documentation of metadata that describe each biological sample and assay method. To facilitate access to all the data created the DCC will construct a state of the art data warehouse. The DCC will design and development robust software to enhance the data submission and unified data processing pipelines, the organization and access to metadata and the data warehouse. In addition, we will develop and maintain the ENCODE Portal that will be the primary entry point to the wealth of experimentally determined information as well as results of computational analyses. The Portal will integrate these data resources and make them available via enhanced search and browsing capabilities. Tools will be implemented to aid discovery by both experienced bioinformaticians and na\u00efve laboratory staff. The DCC will evolve into a substantial service organization allowing biomedical research to take full advance of the ENCODE results. To this end the DCC will provide documentation via many media including written documentation, video tutorials, webinars, and meeting presentations. The DCC, DAC, production laboratories and AWG will be tightly woven together to create the ENCODE Consortium.",

    "description": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered thousands of genetic variations that are associated with hundreds of complex human diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms of how these variants contribute to disease pathogenesis remain obscure. One of the main hurdles is that the majority of disease-associated variants identified are located in the non-coding regions, whose annotations and functions are traditionally poorly understood. Thanks to recent efforts by the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap projects, we have identified millions of potential non-coding regulatory elements in the human genome, mainly based on high-throughput assays such as DNase-Seq or ChIP-Seq data. More importantly, it has been shown that 77% of the disease-associated SNPs are located within a potential regulatory region. However, there have been very few studies in which functional experiments were properly performed to elucidate how SNPs can disrupt the function of a distal regulatory element and influence the phenotypes. Another daunting task is how to identify target genes for the distal regulatory elements that harbor the disease-associated SNP. This is a challenging problem because enhancers can work from either upstream or downstream of their target genes, and can be located as far as 1 million base pairs away and still function through chromatin looping. High-throughput methods based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as Hi-C and ChIA-PET, and Capture Hi-C) and represent an unprecedented opportunity to study higher-order chromatin structure genome-wide. However, data analysis and interpretation for 3C types of data are still in their early stages, and the complex relationship between chromatin interactions and gene regulation has just started to be unraveled. The mechanisms of how TADs, sub-TADs and domain boundaries are formed remains unclear. On the other hand, the impact of 3D structure on gene transcript and epigenetic landscape is also largely unknown and whether they are the cause or the consequence of 3D genome structure is yet to be explored as well. Given the aforementioned challenges and my unique multi-disciplinary training, my long-term goal is to use a combination of high throughput genomic experiments, computational modeling, and functional assays to address the following fundamental questions: 1) How to identify non-coding causal variants for human diseases? 2) What is the molecular mechanism for the formation of 3D genome organization? 3) What is the impact of 3D genome organization on gene regulation and human diseases? The proposed work will deepen our understanding on how genetic variants contribute to gene regulation, 3D genome organization and molecular mechanisms underlying human diseases.",

    "description": "Temporal and tissue-specific gene expression in mammals depends on complex interactions between transcriptional regulatory proteins and cis-elements such as promoter, enhancers and insulators. Previous large-scale efforts have produced an excellent catalog of transcriptional start sites for most mammalian genes but the mechanisms that control the activation of each promoter in specific cell types remains largely Unknown. To better understand the regulatory mechanisms of tissue- and cell type-specific gene expression, it is important to characterize the activities of each promoter in specific cell types, and identify the cis-regulatory elements including enhancers and insulators for each gene. Here, we propose to use the laboratory mouse as a model system and conduct genome-wide analysis of active promoters, enhancers and insulator elements in a panel of embryonic and adult tissues with medical relevance. Specifically, we will (1) identify the active promoters in the mouse genome in a representative set of embryonic and adult tissues; (2) identify potential enhancers and insulator elements in the mouse genome in the same embryonic and adult tissues; (3) identify and characterize tissue-specific promoters and enhancers in the mouse genome; and (4) validate the function of a select set of identified promoters and enhancers. The proposed study, if completed, will result in a comprehensive map of promoters, potential enhancers and insulators throughout the mouse genome. The resource will provide a foundation for analyzing the gene regulatory networks in the mouse cells, and guide the functional annotation of the mouse genome. The results will also help understand the evolution of cis-regulatory sequences, when compared to similar results to be made available as the human ENCODE project progresses. The laboratory mouse represents an important model system for understanding human biology and the molecular basis of human diseases. As a reference to the human genome, the mouse genome sequence has proved extremely valuable in gene annotation. The utility of the laboratory mouse as a model system is currently limited by the lack of understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms that control both common and species-specific gene expression programs in mouse cells. In this project, we propose to define the set of genomic sequences known as cis-regulatory elements in the mouse genome. These regulatory DNA consists of promoters, enhancers, insulators and other regulatory sequences. As a key step towards understanding the gene regulatory mechanisms in mammalian cells, we will produce a comprehensive map of promoters, enhancers and insulators in the mouse genome. We will use a newly developed, high throughput experimental strategy to identify these sequences that are engaged in gene activation in the mouse embryonic stem cells, embryonic fibroblasts, and a panel of embryonic and adult tissues. We will identify tissue specific promoters and enhancers, and characterize the regulatory mechanisms that control the gene expression programs in the specific tissues. Completion of the proposed research is expected to improve our knowledge of the gene regulatory mechanisms in mammalian cells, and provide a reference for understanding the same process in human beings.",

    "description": "Comparative sequence analyses are an essential component of contemporary genomics research. We are continuing to develop and apply new methods for detecting more complex types of evolutionary sequence constraint, such as lineage-specific constrained sequences or weakly constrained sequences, as well as other types of constraint that might not be reflected in the primary nucleotide sequence. Furthermore, we are utilizing inter-species sequence analyses of functional annotations to identify sequence signatures that might confer function; such approaches are particularly useful for detecting short sequences not evolutionarily constrained in orthologous positions across multiple species, but whose relative position to genes and other features is important. The Section is also developing high-throughput methods to experimentally detect and classify functional genomic sequences. This approach utilizes a flow-cytometry-based selection of GFP-reporter constructs harboring candidate enhancer sequences. Preliminary results are promising and have validated that known sequences with enhancer activity can be detected. Scaling this approach to larger regions of the genome will require the use of new-generation sequencing technologies. We have begun to feed into this pipeline various input DNAs, including those selected to be in an active state (so-called FAIRE sites) as well as synthetically generated random sequences. Along these lines, the Section is utilizing a next-generation sequencing technology from Illumina/Solexa. We are working both on the wet-lab side to get the machine working optimally, as well as the informatics side, developing approaches to maximize the amount of high-quality sequence data that can be extracted from the new instrument. We are pursuing a number of applications, including ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, and other \"tag\" based counting experiments, as well as medically-relevant whole genome sequencing projects that can now be pursued at a dramatically reduced cost. This work will not only enable the above-mentioned research projects in my Section, but also many others in the Institute looking to take advantage of this new technology for their own projects. More recently, we have described patterns of gene expression in layers of the brain and improved the specificity of whole-genome analyses.",

This means discovering and mapping all parts of all genes, including exons, introns, promoters and cis-regulatory sequences, in previous phases of the ENCODE Project, the applicants of this proposal developed and applied robust, high-throughput, genome-wide methods for determining transcription factor occupancy, assessing DNA methylation, identifying RNA transcripts, and experimentally testing candidate regulatory elements and mutations. The combination of experiences from the previous phases with the resulting technology and analysis platforms and the existing, highly productive infrastructure of the applicants form the basis of this response to NHGRI's RFA-HG-11-024 (\"Expanding the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) in the Human and Model Organisms\"). This application presents an ambitious proposal to expand the biological dimensions of ENCODE to include essentially all transcription factors for measurements of occupancy and to produce transcriptomes from hundreds of very specific cell types, and even single cells. The specific plan is to: 1) determine genome wide occupancy for all transcription factors and major cofactors with high resolution in two or more cell types; 2) map and quantify all messenger RNA transcripts, microRNAs and other non-ribosomal RNAs in more than 300 well-defined, uncultured cell types; 3) map DNA methylation state genome-wide at nucleotide resolution in more than 300 cell types; and 4) apply a high-throughput transient transfection assay system to test the impact of -2,000 candidate regulatory elements on gene regulation. All experimental work in this project will be evaluated by appropriate quality metrics, and after quality control, all data will be rapidly deposited in publi, freely accessible genome databases. In addition, computational analyses, including evaluation of comparative and population genomics data, will be integrated with the experimental production to help ensure quality and to capture information in forms useful to biologists, genomicists, and medical researchers. Completion of these Specific Aims will enable biomedical researchers to better and more rapidly understand the consequences of mutations in genomic disorders, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and almost ail common diseases and, therefore, to more fully realize the potential of genomics to impact human health.",

    "description": "Drosophila presents an ideal model organism for the study of human cis-regulation. Its genome shares the structure and major features of the human genome; all major families of transcription factors, both the basal machinery and site-specific factors; the overall regulatory structure of developmental genes such as the Hox clusters; many of the \"master regulatory\" transcription factor proteins such as PAX6/eyeless and Distalless that control organ or tissue identity. In many cases, human proteins function in Drosophila just as well as Drosophila proteins. In addition to the shared biology, the fly also offers powerful experimental tools not yet available for mammalian species. Its small genome size, at 130 Mb, is amenable to genome-wide systematic experimentation at a resolution not yet achievable in the human. Additionally, a total of 12 fully sequenced species provide one of the richest comparative genomic datasets, powerful enough to identify individual functional binding sites of regulators across the entire genome. Finally, the wealth of high throughput experimental techniques enables us to validate functional predictions in vivo. In this proposal, we exploit these unique features to produce a comprehensive cis-regulatory map of the Drosophila genome, using a combined experimental and computational approach. We will identify fly promoter regions, short and long range enhancers, insulator and repressor regions, and their defining characteristics based on cis-regulatory motifs and grammars, chromatin state, and transcription factor binding. This project serves as a pilot for the full-scale mapping of functional regulatory elements in the human genome. The methods and strategies developed will be crucial for informing the human genome. In addition, the body of knowledge gained will be invaluable in the understanding of many human diseases and disorders due to regulatory malfunction of gene regulation. Drosophila is an ideal model system for this project, for its compact genome size, experimental resources, and comparative genomics power, while retaining all the major characteristics of the human genome for the study of gene regulation.",

    "description": "Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies \u2013 in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET \u2013 have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team.",

    "description": "Abnormal large-scale chromosome structure is a hallmark of cancer and many other human diseases, but the mechanisms linking chromosome structure to function remain unresolved. The temporal order of replication is developmentally regulated at the level of large (400-800kb) \"replication domains\" that correspond to stable units of chromosome structure. Our long-term goal is to understand the role of largescale chromosome architecture in cell fate transitions. The objective of this application is to determine the causal interdependency of changes in replication timing and its correlated chromosome properties during human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation. Our central hypothesis is that differentiation signals directiy modify replication timing to alter chromatin composition, which will in turn influence 3D folding in the next cell cycle, contributing to the robustness of transcription networks. Our rationale is that knowledge of causal relationships is an essential first step of mechanistic studies linking large-scale chromosome structure to cell fate transitions. Aimi will determine the order in which changes in replication timing, histone modifications, 3P chromatin interactions and transcription occur in response to differentiation and their dependence upon completion of prior events. Preliminary data describe newly developed hESC differentiation and cell cycle synchronization methods that can achieve this goal. Aim2 will test the hypothesis that human Rifl protein, which we recentiy identified as essential to maintain replication timing, is redistributed during differentiation to regulate replication timing. Gene disruption, genome wide ChlP, and single cell methods will localize Rifl and determine its role in regulating replication and transcription. These Aims are significant because identifying causal relationships and molecular players involved will remove a major obstacle in the field, paving the way to investigate mechanisms linking large-scale chromosome structure to cell fate commitment and, ultimately, human disease. The work is innovative in developing a system to study cell cycle regulated events in response to differentiation and in pioneering investigations into the newly identified role of Rifl in replication timing during early human development.",

    "description": "Complete annotation of all functional sequences in the human genome remains a major challenge a decade after its initial sequencing. This pertains in particular to gene regulatory elements, many of which are located far away from their target genes, but play fundamental roles in human biology. Significant progress towards annotation of the gene regulatory architecture has been made in recent years predominantly using cultured human cells. However, large-scale studies in mice, as well as anecdotal examples identified in human studies, have indicated the existence of large populations of gene regulatory sequences with very restricted temporal and tissue-specific activity during mammalian development. Despite their critical importance in human development and disease, this set of regulatory sequences will likely be missed by approaches restricted to cell lines or adult tissues. To fill this gap, the major objective for this U54 application is to generate catalogs of developmentally active gene regulatory sequences using existing high throughput data production pipelines for genomic approaches including ChlP-Seq, MethylC-Seq and RNA-Seq on embryonic tissues. Performing such studies directly on human tissues is not feasible due to limited availability of human embryos at relevant stages of development. We will therefore in this study exploit the laboratory mouse, a widely used animal model that shares a similar embryonic developmental program and gene regulatory architecture with humans. In addition to embryonic development, our studies will also generate a complementary reference dataset from postnatal and adult mice to better understand the dynamics of gene regulation over time. Furthermore, we will assess the biological authenticity of identified regulatory sequences by in-depth functional validation using an established transgenic mouse pipeline. It is anticipated that generation of these datasets will fill a major void in the functional annotation o a mammalian genome and help to complete the catalog of gene regulatory sequences in the human genome.",

    "description": "Our current understanding of gene regulatory networks does not adequately utilize information from individual protein-DNA interactions and the millions of regulatory elements identified by high-throughput functional assays. New strategies are needed to incorporate data from each of these experimental scales, and to leverage the orthogonal datasets to understand how each regulatory element is involved in directing complex gene expression responses. The objective of our proposal is to develop statistical models to learn the underlying patterns of complex interactions involved in transcription regulation across the genome. While the genome-proximal response to glucocorticoid (GC) treatment is an ideal model system, the methods developed will be applicable to studying any complex regulatory network. The goal of Aim 1 will be to comprehensively characterize the first 12 hours of the GC response using genome-wide methods to quantify expression, TF binding, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, three-dimensional chromatin structure, and the function of regulatory elements. The outcome will be the most comprehensive and coordinated molecular description of a human regulatory network ever produced. All data will be generated with the highest possible quality standards, and will be submitted pre-publication and without restriction into the public domain. Aim 2 will integrate that data into a nonparametric and hierarchical Bayesian model of the GC response network (GCRN). That model will able to produce functional predictions for each individual regulatory element while also generalizing across genes to reveal shared principles of gene regulation. Aim 3 will validate and reduce uncertainty in the model. That will be accomplished by combining statistical experimental design approaches with multiplex genome and epigenome engineering to iteratively and optimally resolve the most uncertain aspects of the model. The outcome will be a validated and predictive model of the GCRN that will be useful to design customized genomic responses. Aim 4 will demonstrate the use of the resulting model through reprogramming the GCRN to minimize the response of genes associated with metabolism while maintaining the response of genes associated with inflammation and immunity. The outcome will be a derived cell line with a custom programmed GC response. That cell line will have immediate use for studying individual aspects of the GC response; and the approach used to design and realize the customized response will have broad implications for the study of other transcriptional response networks. The overall result of this project will be a mechanistic and actionable understanding of the principles through which individual DNA sequences contribute to the GCRN; a general and transferrable multi-scale modeling approach to study any complex regulatory network; and the novel ability to genetically reprogram transcriptional response networks to study their individual components. We anticipate that that outcome will have broad positive impact on both experimental and computational fields of biomedical research.",

    "description": "We propose to map major core histone variants throughout the annotated Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes at high resolution. These maps will provide a chromatin-based framework for interpreting epigenetic information and gene expression patterns determined by others. To accomplish this, we will use the biotin-tagging system that we have successfully applied for genome-scale chromatin affinity purification together with a standard microarray readout platform. In both D. melanogaster and C. elegans we will profile the universal replication-independent histone 3 variant, H3.3, as well as the control replication-coupled variant, H3. These data will provide high-resolution genome-wide maps of histone dynamics in both model organisms. The close correspondences of H3.3 patterns to patterns of active histone modifications genome-wide and with DNasel hypersensitive sites at homeotic gene clusters suggests that our genome-wide maps can be used to validate efforts aimed at mapping these other genomic features. In both D. melanogaster and C. elegans we will also profile the H2AZ variant, which has been linked to epigenetic processes in a variety of different organisms. Drosophila H2AZ plays a unique dual role as the H2AX variant, called H2AV, and our preliminary studies indicate that patterns of H2AV differ from those of H3.3, thus providing a different epigenetic profile of histone dynamics genome-wide. To expand our understanding of the functional roles of both classes of histone variants, we will use RNAi to knock down the function of key chromatin regulators in Drosophila cell lines and in whole C. elegans at different developmental stages. Transcriptional profiling after knock-down of the variants and their assembly machines will provide functional validation of roles that they play in gene regulation, and histone variant profiling after knock-down should help to identify target genes. Together with other types of genome-wide information our histone variant maps are likely to contribute to a fuller understanding of epigenetic regulatory elements in the genomes of these two model organisms. Given that the same histone variants are thought to play similar roles in essentially all complex eukaryotes, our basic approach can be immediately applied to the human genome.",

    "description": "Most human genes produce multiple distinct mRNA and protein isoforms through alternative splicing that may have distinct or even antagonistic biological functions. Alternative splicing is regulated by a set of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) whose functions are important in development and in a number of diseases. Our approach to the long-term goal of understanding the function of RBPs and their roles in alternative splicing is organized around the following specific aims: SA1. To develop a method for determination of the quantitative in vitro RNA binding specificity of a protein at unprecedented depth and to determine the RNA affinity landscape of RBFOX family proteins. SA2. To understand the sequence and RNA structural basis of RNA binding by MBNL and CELF family splicing factors, the extent of cooperativity and competition, and to understand the regulation of distinct subsets of targets in developmental and pathogenic contexts. SA3. To understand the binding affinity landscapes of factors that recognize motifs at the 3' ends of introns and their roles in regulation of alternative 3' splice site (3'SS) choice. We have recently developed a method called HiTS-FLIP, which provides a quantitative description of the in vitro DNA binding affinity landscape of a protein at unprecedented depth. We propose to develop a variation of this method, \"HiTS-FLIP-R\", to assess RNA binding affinity at a similarly high resolution. The essential idea is to sequence tens of millions of DNA clusters on an Illumina Genome Analyzer 2 (GA2) flow cell, to generate the corresponding RNA sequences by primer extension of anchored DNA adapters, to add a fluorescently tagged RNA binding protein to the flow cell at various concentrations and to image binding to RNA clusters using the GA2's optics. This approach will be applied to key factors involved in development and disease, including RBFOX2 and the myotonic dystrophy (DM) related factors MBNL1 and CELF1, as well as major factors that recognize the 3' splice site and contribute to constitutive and alternative splicing. These data will be used to develop quantitative models that predict the effects on binding and regulation of defined perturbations in the levels of specific RBPs, and the roles of these factors in development and in DM.",

    "description": "The modENCODE project is a key sequel to the sequencing of the fly and worm genomes, and will have an enormous impact on our understanding of biological processes in all higher eukaryotes, including human. In order to manage the diverse, large-scale datasets that will be produced by modENCODE, we propose to create a data coordinating center (DCC) to track the data, integrate it with other information sources, and make it available to the research community in a timely and open fashion. This proposal brings together four groups with highly relevant backgrounds: The Micklem group, through its work on the InterMine system and FlyMine database, has extensive experience in integrating diverse types of data into high-performance data mining systems. The Stein and Lewis groups bring to the project an intimate familiarity with the C. elegans and D. melanogaster genomes, their reagents and research communities, and are well-positioned by their work with the WormBase and FlyBase databases to liaise with those MODs. The Kent group is responsible for the DCC for the Human ENCODE pilot project, and has extensive practical knowledge of developing and managing projects of this sort. We will assemble a team of three data managers stationed at CSHL and at Berkeley, who have a background in the bioinformatics of C. elegans and/or D. melanogaster. The managers will liaise with their contacts at the data provider sites to determine data file formats, milestones and quality control procedures for their datasets. They will also liaise with representatives from NCBI to coordinate modENCODE activities with the primary data repositories at GenBank and GEO. Data providers will upload their data sets to a staging server where they will be able to preview their data on an instance of the GBrowse genome browser. The data managers will QC the data before approving its transfer to the production database. Data will be integrated in the production database using InterMine, and from there released to the public on a monthly schedule. Researchers will be able to access the data via the GBrowse genome browser, bulk downloads, and via complex queries and reports mediated by InterMine and the BioMart data warehousing system. All major software systems used by the proposed DCC will be based on open source tools from the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD), human ENCODE, and other sources. Throughout the project, Lewis and Stein will work close with FlyBase and/or WormBase to ensure that data collected by modENCODE becomes an integral part of the relevant model organism database. In addition we will dedicate a significant part of a data manager's effort to transfer data from modENCODE into the MODs during the last year of the project.",

    "description": "Although our ability to determine the genome sequence of individuals is becoming facile, our understanding of the function of most of the human genome is limited. Mapping of regulatory information is particularly crucial since most (>85%) common variants associated with human disease lie outside of coding regions. Previous phases of ENCODE have made important contributions to the mapping of regulatory elements across the genome, but there is much more to be acheived, including the mapping of regulatory regions across many more tissues and at the resolution of individual cells as well as determining the exact regulators i.e. transcription factors that bind each region. In our Stanford ENCODE Production Center for Mapping of Regulatory Regions, we plan to use technologies that we have developed to map the binding sites for most transcription factors (TFs) in five major cell lines using chromatin immunoprecipitation of tagged TFs. We will further expand the catalog of regulatory elements by analyzing open chromatin regions in these cell lines and a wide variety of tissues and cell types from both normal and diseased human subjects consented for open access. Finally, we will map open chromatin regions in single cells from these types of biosamples. These studies will greatly expand the catalog of regulatory regions in the human genome. The rapid deposition of data into the ENCODE Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will ensure quick public release. We expect the data and cell lines that are generated by this Center will be a valuable resource for the broad scientific community.",

    "description": "It is said that if the genome represents the set of things that the cell could say, then the transcriptome represents the set of things that the cell is saying right now. The transcriptome is the primary read-out of the genome and is composed mainly of mRNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and microRNAs. At all stages of life, in health and in disease, differences in the transcriptome causally define and distinguish each cell type and cell state. The mission of the ENCODE Consortium is to discover, map and define all genes and their regulatory elements. RNA-Seq data and the resulting transcriptomes have therefore been a prominent component of prior phases of ENCODE, and our groups have contributed over 350 released poly(A) mRNA and microRNA datasets for the project. Valuable and high quality as those data are, we are new technologies will allow us to produce a new generation of transcriptomes that are much more information rich and definitive. Specifically, they resolve the multiple different cell types that comprise complex tissues, and they resolve the molecular isoforms in the data. They qualitatively document long-range single molecule splicing and end processing and we provide companion quantification of microRNAs, plus discovery of their often-undocumented precursor RNAs. Finally, we map RNA secondary structure across the transcriptome in vivo. We propose to contribute 300 new, higher precision transcriptomes containing these measurement types and their integrated analysis. A portion of this study focuses on aging humans and mice, a whole life cycle stage that has not previously been studied in ENCODE. The corresponding disease component will contrast the cognitively normal old with Alzheimers dementia in the brain and in the motor system.",

    "description": "The goal of the ENCODE Project is to provide the scientific community with a complete annotation of the human genome by delineating the DNA sequence features that comprise all genes, including exons, introns, promoters and cis-regulatory sequences. The pilot ENCODE project sought to develop and test a variety of experimental, computational and analytical platforms to determine the best ways to approach this problem by focusing on a defined 1% of the human genome. During this initial phase of ENCODE, the applicants of this proposal developed robust high-throughput methods for detecting and validating functional transcription promoters, DNA methylation patterns, and transcription factor occupancy in the pilot regions, and demonstrated that these approaches can be scaled fully to the entire human genome with high robustness, sensitivity and specificity. These experiences, together with the resulting technology and analysis platforms and an existing, highly productive infrastructure, lead to this response to NHGRI's RFA-HG-07-030. This application presents an ambitious proposal to expand a program to map and functionally annotate cis-regulatory sequences of the human genome. The plan emphasizes full genome-comprehensivity for three experimental pipelines.: 1) a new sequence-based method called ChlPSeq to elucidate more than 600 comprehensive transcription factor:DNA interactomes; 2) a similar new method called MethSeq to determine the methylation status of all the CpG-rich regions in the human genome in more than 1,000 human cell types and cell states; and 3) a high throughput transfection assay pipeline to measure transcriptional activities of 25,000 human \"promoter-plus\" proximal cis-regulatory domains, including at least one major promoter for each of the annotated protein-coding genes. A second major product of the promoter pipeline will be a physical resource of proximate reporter constructs for all human genes, designed to accommodate future fine-structure dissection of the promoter regulatory motifs and testing of long-distance elements. All of the experimental work in this project will be subjected to analysis with appropriate quality metrics. In addition, comparative genomics and other computational analyses will be integrated with the experimental production to help prioritize and shape input to the pipelines and to capture information in forms useful to both biologists and genomicists. These analyses will produce several large-scale deliverables, including hundreds of ChIP data-driven sequence motif models, some of which additionally leverage evolutionary conservation for each of hundreds of transcription factors.",

    "description": "While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 3000 loci associated with common disease, the mechanism by which variation at these loci are pathogenic remains unclear. The ENCODE project provides a unique resource of extensive functional genomic data that can be used to close this knowledge gap. The overall objective of this application is to develop computational methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with GWAS data to predict simultaneously the relevant tissue type and functionally important variants for a given disease. A secondary objective is to validate these approaches through the analysis of data on cancer and autoimmune disease. The central hypothesis is that loci identified through GWAS tag functional SNPs that cause disease by altering transcription factor binding sites, thereby dysregulating genes in the relevant tissue typ (e.g. pre-neoplastic tissue for cancer and immune cells for autoimmune disease). The rationale that underlies this research is that the ENCODE data represents a rich resource for understanding GWAS results and that the methods to be developed here will enable similar analysis on other diseases. The research team is well prepared to undertake the proposed research because of their combined expertise in the conduct and analysis of GWAS, functional and bioinformatics follow-up of GWAS hits, and machine learning approaches to understanding genome-scale data including transcription factor binding. The central hypothesis will be tested through these aims: 1) Determine if ENCODE data generated in the appropriate tissue type can be used to find putative functional transcriptional regulatory variants at disease-associated loci. This will be achieved by asking if lymphoma risk SNPs tend to alter transcription factor binding sites and associate with expression of nearby genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines. 2) Using ENCODE data, identify the cell types and tissue(s) important for a given disease. Relevant cell types will be identified by determining those cell types in which genes are more likely to be expressed near disease risk loci in the ENCODE data. 3) Identify putative functional SNPs in GWAS using ENCODE when complete functional genomic data is not available for the appropriate tissue type. To extend these analyses beyond the few cell types extensively studied in ENCODE, DNase hypersensitivity data from the relevant tissue will be linked with ChIP-Seq transcription factor binding data from other tissues to allow identification of variants that alter transcription factor binding. This research is significant because it will provide new insight into the biology of cancer and autoimmune disease. More importantly, it will provide the tools necessary to use the ENCODE data to link disease risk loci with functional variants and potential mechanistic explanations.",

    "description": "A working draft of the human genome has been completed. Transcription of RNA is one of the functional processes which permit the transfer of encoded information from the DNA sequence into function. Recent evidence suggests that the catalogue of transcripts that are made for the human genome is more complex than indicated by current annotations. The locations and characteristics of regulatory elements encoded in the genome which control the expression of these transcripts are even less well understood. The goal of this proposal is to describe a collection of generic and unbiased strategies which can be used, on a genome-wide scale, to locate the sites of transcription and the functional elements which regulate RNA expression. These strategies have high density oligonucleotide arrays and chromatin immunoprecipation (CHIP) as core technologies that will enable the mapping of these sites. For the first year of our proposed ENCODE project, 30 Mb of distributed genomic sequence (approximately 1% of genome) selected from 44 different chromosomal locations ranging in size from 500 kb to 2 Mb will serve as target sequences. A single array with approximately 810,000 probe pairs that interrogate the 30 Mb of sequence at every 37 bp, on average, will be synthesized and used as a common platform to map the locations of both transcription and functional regulatory elements. The functional elements which will be monitored are the binding sites for 15 transcription factors and 4 repressors as well as the locations for 7 types of histone modifications which have been correlated with RNA regulation. Three well-characterized phorbol ester or retinoic acid- responsive cell lines (Jurkat, NCCIT and HL-60) will be temporally monitored when activated by these molecules and will provide the biological context for these studies. To demonstrate the scalability of this collection of strategies, the second and third years of our proposed studies will be focused on constructing a similar collection of maps, at a resolution of 35 bp on average, but across the entire human genome.",

    "description": "The Reference Epigenome Mapping Centers (REMC) will aim to transform our understanding of human epigenetics through production and integrative analysis of comprehensive reference epigenomes for ES cells, differentiated cells and tissues. In pursuit of this goal, we have assembled a unique scientific team and infrastructure with broad expertise and capabilities in stem cell biology, epigenomics, technology, production research and computation. We recently demonstrated two complementary methods that leverage ultra high-throughput sequencing for epigenomic analysis. In the first method, genome-wide chromatin maps are acquired by deep sequencing chromatin IP DNA (ChlP-Seq). In the second, nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps are generated by high-throughput bisulfite-sequencing (HTBS). These methods represent major improvements over prior tools as they yield precise digital information, have high genome coverage, require fewer cells and are cost-effective. Multiple epigenomic maps have already been produced for stem cells and primary tissues, and pipelines have been assembled for efficient data collection, processing and analysis. For the REMC project, we propose to apply ChlP-Seq and HTBS pipelines to generate comprehensive high-resolution maps of chromatin state and DNA methylation for 100 diverse cell types. Cell types were selected for their biological and medical importance, and for their potential to maximize the comprehensiveness of acquired epigenomic data. They include human ES cells, ES-derived cells, mesenchymal stem cells, reprogrammed stem cells and primary tissues. ChlP-Seq will be used to map highly informative chromatin modifications and related chromatin proteins in each cell type. HTBS will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps. Reference epigenomes will reveal the locations and activation states of diverse functional genomic elements, inform on the developmental state and potential of studied cell populations, and provide a framework for understanding complex epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. All data will be made available to the scientific community upon verification. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Comprehensive characterization of epigenetic marks ('the epigenome') is a critical step towards a global understanding of the human genome in health and disease. The proposed mapping studies will provide unprecedented views of the human epigenetic landscape and its variation across cell states, offer fundamental insight into the functions and interrelationships of epigenetic marks, and provide a framework for future studies of normal and diseased epigenomes.",

The ENCODE Consortium brings together laboratories that generate complex data types via experimental assays with laboratories that integrate these unique data using computational analyses to discover how chromosomal elements function together to define the human cell. The DCC's participation enhances the data created by these laboratories through the creation of structured pipelines for the verification and validation of all submitted data and providing processes for the documentation of metadata that describe each biological sample and assay method. To facilitate access to all the data created by the previous ENCODE projects as well as data from the modENCODE project and any other large data collections that are determined to be appropriate for incorporation, the DCC will construct a state of the art data storage repository called the Big Data Hub. The DCC will design and development new software to enhance the data submission and processing pipeline, the organization and access to metadata and the Big Data Hub. In addition, we will create the ENCODE Portal that will be the primary entry point to the wealth of experimentally determined information as well as results of computational analyses. The Portal will integrate these data resources and make them available via enhanced search and browsing capabilities. Tools will be implemented to aid discovery by both experienced bioinformaticians and naive laboratory staff. The DCC will evolve into a substantial service organization allowing biomedical research to take full advance of the ENCODE results. To this end the DCC will provide documentation via many media including written documentation, video tutorials, webinars, and meeting presentations.

    "description": "The expression of genes involves a sequence of enzymatic events, such as transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA decay, and translation, that are subject to gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of protein-nucleic acid interactions. It is well appreciated that the control of transcription via regulatory networks that regulate enhancer and promoter activities are not the sole determinant of what gene products result, but that exon skipping is pervasive and post-transcriptional mechanisms such as mRNA splicing and decay determine the kinetics of mRNA induction and abundance. Indeed, in our preliminary studies of the macrophage response to pathogens, we find that a majority of induced gene expression events result in mRNAs that deviate substantially from those predicted by the genome-browser, and that mRNA decay is controlled by both protein- nucleic acid and miRNA regulatory networks. The proposed Center for the \"Ribonomics\" of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop a predictive model for which mRNA isoforms are expressed and at what level given a given promoter activity and transcription initiation rate. We will develop generally applicable tools in conjunction with or in depth and quantitative experimental analysis of the macrophage response to pathogen-associated endotoxin, which results in the dramatic up regulation of more than 1000 genes. Strikingly, our preliminary data identified more than 900 exon skipping events in addition to numerous cases of alternative 5' or 3' splice site use, emphasizing the essential contribution of post-initiation events. Further, these splice patterns are dependent on the macrophage subtype-specific chromatin landscape and are altered by inducible splice factors in primed or tolerated states. Thus we will leverage the well-described macrophage biology and associated experimental model systems, to examine the role of gene structure and sequence (Aim 1), the role of chromatin modifications (Aim 2), and of trans-acting splicing factors (Aim 3) in determining the identity of mature mRNAs and their associated synthesis rates, before adding the stimulus-responsive regulatory networks that confer mRNA half-life control and thus determine the abundance of each mRNA isoform (Aim 4).",

    "description": "The overall goal of this project is to generate fine-structure RNA maps in human and mouse (C57BL/6NJ) tissues and primary cell lines using a variety of high-throughput sequencing platforms, to evaluate the biological importance of novel transcripts by determining if evidence of their translated products can be identified. From each sample analyzed, we propose to isolate long (>200 nucleotides) and short (< 200 nucleotides) RNA in biological duplicate. Illumina-based maps for these samples will initially be generated using (1) RNA sequencing (-seq) of ribosomal (r-)RNA depleted long total RNA. (2) RNA-seq of tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) pre-treated short RNA (3) Pair-end Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (PE-CAGE) of total RNA. Additionally, for a subset of primary cell lines we will generate the above libraries from nuclear and cytoplasmic subcellular fractions. Long RNA-Seq data will be distilled down into functional elements consisting of splice junctions, polyadenylatio sites and de novo genes and transcripts. The short RNA data will be distilled into contigs representing the 5' ends of short RNAs up to the read length. PE-CAGE data will be analyzed to form clusters representing the 5' ends of transcripts linked to a tag internal to the transcript body. Importantly, each element will be assessed for reproducibility using a nonparametric Irreproducible Detection Rate (nplDR) script. Collectively, these data will allow for the detection of novel transcribed regions and supportive information as to the location of promoter regions and subcellular residence of transcripts. In aggregate, these data will be used to generate models of both noncoding and protein coding transcripts and to distinguish isoforms at complex loci necessary to obtain a comprehensive view of mammalian transcriptomes. For a subset of these samples we will simultaneously collect the genome sequence of the human donors to provide a reference map that will be used to map the RNA data against and derive information concerning allele-specific expression and RNA editing. Unannotated transcript models will be tested using long-range (PacBio/454) sequencing. Lastly, proteogenomic analysis will be done and the results compared against the unannotated transcripts.",

    "description": "Large-scale efforts are underway to systematically map transcription factors binding sites throughout the human genome. The ENCODE project has focused its initial attention on two cell lines, 1) K562 cells, a myeloid precursor cell line and 2) GM12878, a lymphoblastoid cell line, and our laboratory has mapped the binding sites of a large number of transcription factor expressed in these cells. To study their conservation and help provide functional information into these binding sites and to determine if these sites are occupied in vivo, we propose two types of studies. First, we will map the binding sites of at least 30 transcription factor orthologs that have been analyzed in the human ENCODE project in mouse MEL and CH12 cells which are analogous to K562 and GM12878 cells, respectively. Second, we will map the binding sites of Pol II and nine other factors in cells differentiated from human CD34+ cells and primary erythroid mouse cells. These studies will determine which transcription factor binding sites and gene targets are conserved in vertebrates and which are species-specific as well as determine the extent to which targets mapped in cultured cell lines reflect in vivo binding sites. The information from these studies will be deposited into public databases and is expected to be extremely valuable to the large mouse and human genetic communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ENCODE project has produced relatively large amounts of data on transcription factor binding and RNA expression in a limited number of human cell lines. We propose to extend these results by obtaining mouse cell lines at similar states of differentiation to human cell lines. We will then duplicate the experiments that have been done in human cells, and locate control elements based on sequence conservation and similarities in factor binding between the two species. We will also determine if elements identified in vitro are occupied in cells isolated from organisms.",

    "description": "Genome sequencing efforts are producing ever greater quantities of raw DNA sequence, but the annotation process for locating and determining the function of genetic elements has not kept up. While many aspects of annotation are difficult, it is particularly challenging to determine which parts of a genome sequence encode proteins, and therefore how the processes leading to protein translation are regulated. Not only are technologies for examining proteins more limited than those for studying RNA transcription, in an extensive study of transcription by the Encyclopedia of DNA elements consortium, a picture of great complexity emerged. The project uncovered many novel exons, alternative splice forms, and novel regulatory elements. These results indicate that nearly 9/10ths of human genes undergo alternative splicing, and the average gene produces approximately 6 splice variants. Rather than solidify knowledge regarding the location and function of genes, these results question whether we accurately know what constitutes a gene, and how the products encoded by genes determine the function of cells. The results particularly obfuscate determination of which transcripts are selected for translation to protein, further complicating annotation efforts. To address that gap, our project will determine which transcripts encode proteins, and how these are affected in several tissue types and disease conditions. We will use large tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data sets, mapping the analyzed protein data directly to several available human genome sequences, along with sets of predicted transcripts produced by the N-SCAN and CONTRAST gene finders, to reveal which parts of transcripts are translated into proteins, and in which types of cells this translation occurs. To accomplish this, our project has three specific aims: 1) to develop high-accuracy methods and software for mapping proteomic data from mass spec analyzed proteins directly to the genome locus encoding them; 2) to develop an analysis pipeline software system using a novel rule-based information management approach; and 3) to apply these developments for the high-throughput analysis of large proteomic data sets, identifying the transcripts that encode proteins in distinct tissue types and disease conditions, and placing the results in a publicly accessible track in the UCSC genome browser. We believe this project will yield significant knowledge about the location and timing of protein translation in cells, which will potentiate further investigation of how misregulation of the path from transcription to translation leads to human disease conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sequencing of the human genome is complete, but figuring out where genes are located, how they function, and how they cause or prevent human diseases like cancer has only just begun. Genes act as blueprints for RNA and proteins, the workhorses of the cell. We are developing technologies to address the key challenges of determining which genes specify the building of which proteins and how this process is orchestrated to ultimately unravel how disease processes occur.",

    "description": "The ENCODE project has produced high-resolution, high-quality maps of components of the `regulome' in a set of tissues and cell lines, identifying a collection of putative regulatory elements. Our proposal aims to test the functional relevance of these putative elements with high-throughput, pooled CRISPR screens. This powerful platform will allow us to up-regulate, down-regulate, or mutate specific regulatory elements, and then probe the effects of these perturbations on cell survival under normal growth conditions, and a variety of stress conditions (oxidative stress, ricin toxicity, and nutrient deprivation) that produce differential sensitivities to gene expression. To establish our targets, we will use ENCODE data in concert with other consortia-generated data using an integrative analysis pipeline that leverages both correlation between element activity and gene expression, and higher order chromatin interactions to link functional elements with potential target genes. For ~3000 genes for which we have observed that perturbation affects proliferation, we will generate multiple libraries of ~100,000 guide RNAs for redundantly perturbing 20,000 enhancers linked to these genes through our analysis. After identifying \u201chits\u201d in this screen by sequencing the guide RNA libraries before and after proliferation under our test conditions to observe a reduction in specific guides, we will also test combinations of enhancer elements that may act in a cooperative or redundant fashion, exploring the functional linkages with a specific focus on superenhancers and their sub-elements. With these phenotypic validation data in hand, we will carry out molecular mechanistic validation by choosing 100 individual elements, and 50 combinations of elements to generate stable cell lines with engineered genetic ablation of elements, and carry out genome- wide molecular characterization of accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq), chromatin looping (HiChIA, a novel, high- efficiency chromatin looping assay), and gene expression (RNA-seq). We will also generate and assess 50 lines ablating entire superenhancers and individual superenhancer elements \u2013 both individually in in combination. For a subset of these lines, we will carry out single cell ATAC-seq to unravel effects on variations of open chromatin within the population of cells. We will also compare results from pooled CRISPR expression reporter assays to our method of generating edits in the native genomic context. Analyzing these data using powerful, integrative analysis methods, scaffolded from ENCODE data, will generate global maps of the molecular consequences of deletions at the level of chromatin and gene expression changes. These data will be rapidly released to the community, and all techniques and cell lines will be made available to the ENCODE consortium and to the genomics community at large. This project will deliver an immense corpus of functional data linking regulatory elements to genes, as well as extensive molecular characterization of a subset of these regulatory elements, providing a scaffold for understanding classes and logic of functional elements, validating computational predictions, and providing techniques that broadly extensible to other cell types and tissues.",

    "description": "The human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a unique model system for investigating the mechanisms of human development due to their ability to replicate indefinitely while retaining the capacity to differentiate into a host of functionally distinct cell types. In addition, these cells could be potentially used as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Differentiation of hESCs involves selective activation or silencing of genes, a process controlled in part by the epigenetic state of the cell. In order to gain a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating differentiation of hESCs, and produce general reference epigenome maps of the human cells, we propose to establish an Epigenome Center in San Diego. Our center will be focused on both undifferentiated hESC and four hESC-derived early embryonic cell lineages including extraembryonic endoderm, trophoblast, mesendoderm (a common precursor to mesodermal and endodermal lineages), and mesenchymal cells (a specific mesoderm derivative). We have developed and validated high throughput technologies for mapping the state of DNA methylation and chromatin modifications throughout the genome, and will use these methods to generate high-resolution maps of the reference epigenomes. Specifically, we will grow and differentiate hESCs into multiple lineages, and map DNA methylation sites using a newly developed technology that combines bisulfite conversion and whole genome shotgun sequencing. We will also determine the histone modification status in the genome by performing both ChlP-chip and ChlP-Seq analysis. We will develop advanced statistical and algorithmic solutions to facilitate high-throughput sequencing data analysis, and establish an informatics pipeline for collecting, storage, and distribution of epigenome maps. Finally, we will perform integrated data analysis to identify new epigenetic patterns in the genome that could provide insights in mechanisms of epigenetic regulation.",

    "description": "The goal of this proposal is to identify at high resolution all active gene regulatory elements in the human genome among cell types representative of most human tissues. We will accomplish this goal by identifying regions of open chromatin with two independent and complementary methods: DNasel hypersensitivity and Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE), combined with single-nucleosome mapping and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for selected regulatory factors. The immediate benefit of success will be a high-quality public atlas of the human DNA regulatory elements that are likely to be active in each cell type. Identification of open chromatin regions has been one of the most accurate and robust methods to identify functional promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and locus control regions in mammalian cells. A principal advantage of an open chromatin approach is that all potential sites in the genome are simultaneously assayed in an unbiased manner. DNasel hypersensitivity and FAIRE interrogate chromatin by entirely different underlying mechanisms, and therefore represent independent, cross-validating assessments of chromatin state. In addition, we will perform single-nucleosome mapping in selected cell types as an independent direct biochemical verification of open chromatin regions. For a selected subset of cell-types, we will further annotate open chromatin regions with respect to their biological activity by determining the binding location of proteins that mark transcription start sites, transcriptional units, insulators, or have broad regulatory function. The Aims of this proposal are 1) to identify all regions of open chromatin in 40 cell types by DNasel and FAIRE analyses, and 2) determine the biological function of open chromatin regions by ChIP and nucleosome mapping. To accomplish these Aims, we have assembled a team of five researchers who are leaders in their respective fields and who have contributed significantly to the ENCODE pilot project. Furthermore, we have developed a streamlined pipeline, which has been used to generate high quality whole-genome data from a number of cell types.",

    "description": "Transcriptional regulation is extremely important and highly complex in humans. In this project, we focus on the transcriptional regulation of alternative first exons in a tissue specific manner. First exons are often poorly characterized in eukaryotic genomes. Furthermore, alternative first exons can reside in genomic locations that are far apart from each other, leading to distinct usage of proximal promoters. There are numerous examples in the literature on widely separated alternative promoters that are responsible for tissue specific expression. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that alternative splicing of first exons is indicative of alternative proximal promoter usage, which will be an important factor in our identification of functional cis-element clusters that regulate differential tissue-specific gene expressions. The project tightly couples the computational expertise in Weng's laboratory with the extremely sensitive and quantitative gene expression technique recently developed by Ding and Cantor at Boston University. We will computationally characterize all genes in the 30 Mb of human sequence selected by the ENCODE project, identify ~ 100 genes with alternative first exon splicing, study the expression levels of splicing variants in major tissue types, and investigate the cis-elements in the promoters of these genes that could account for their transcriptional regulation. The project has four specific aims: 1) Computationally analyze the ENCODE sequences and select ~100 genes that exhibit both alternative first exon usage and tissue specific expression patterns; 2) Experimentally validate first exon usage for all genes identified in Aim 1 and measure their expression levels in ten major tissue types; 3) Computationally predict cis-element clusters in the alternative proximal promoters of the genes and select ~40 most confident predictions that may account for tissue-specific expressions; and 4) Experimentally test the ~40 computational predictions using transfection assays in five cell lines.",

    "description": "We have organized a \"3'UTRome Consortium\" whose modENCODE goal is to map all 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) and their functional sequence elements in C. elegans. 3'UTRs are DNA encoded elements that are co-transcribed along with mRNAs and whose role is to regulate the activity of mRNA. We currently have only a partial and biased view of the global 3'UTRs sequences (3'UTRome) for any metazoan and have even less information on the motifs in the 3'UTRs that are used by trans-acting factors to drive gene regulation. Yet, what is known reveals a high level of complexity where 3'UTRs are often tissue-specific or are subject to alternative splicing events that lead to 3'UTR sequence diversity that parallels the diversity seen within the coding region of the transcript. Small non-coding RNAs (eg. microRNAs) are a class of posttranscriptional regulators that function through motifs found in the 3'UTRs; however only a subset of 3'UTR::microRNA motifs are though to be known. MicroRNAs add to the previously established fundamental role of RNA-binding proteins known to regulate expression; however, even less is known about these protein-binding motifs. C. elegans provides an excellent model to reveal the DNA-encoded functional elements that drive these complex events in a system where the genome is completely mapped and where 3'UTRs are comparatively compact. We propose to build on our preliminary studies and use a combination of in vitro, in vivo and in silico approaches to identify most or all 3'UTRs and functional sequence elements within them. Specifically, we propose to use genome-wide RT-PCR-based strategies to identify all 3'UTRs in C. elegans; to use computational approaches, microarray analysis and deep sequencing to reveal the vast majority of 3'UTR::microRNA binding motifs and use RIP-CHIP, Yeast-3-Hybrid and computational analysis to map the 3'UTR::RNA-binding-Protein motifs. To use genome data in medicine we need to build a map of the DNA elements that could affect every gene's activity. We are proposing to build a critical part of such a map using the model animal C. elegans by identifying all the 3'UTRs (sequence elements that regulate gene expression) as well as dissect the 3'UTRs and identify sub-elements that are responsible for the 3'UTR's functions.",

These studies will be critical for deciphering the regulatory information housed in the genome to direct development and homeostasis. To maximize quality, speed, and comprehensiveness of the data collection, we have assembled a highly qualified team with extensive experience in performing the proposed goals, and developed a streamlined procedure for implementing these goals. First, we will make constructs in which each transcription factor is fused to a dual Myc-mCherry fluorescent tag. These constructs will be used to generate transgenic strains that express each tagged transcription factor at endogenous levels and locations. We will examine the temporal and spatial expression of each factor and determine its precise location using automated imaging techniques. Based on the optimal expression of each factor, we will perform genome-wide mapping of its binding sites in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by hybridization to a microarray containing probes distributed across the entire genome. These binding data will be validated by multiple methods, including quantitative PCR of ChIP samples, expression analysis in transcription factor knockout strains, and mutational analysis of candidate binding sites in transgenic reporters. We will perform bioinformatic analysis to identify regulatory motifs and compare motifs between factors.

    "description": "Our project seeks to identify the regulatory elements recognized by the vast majority of transcription factors (TFs) in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In the initial modENCODE project, an experimental pipeline was developed and applied to -100 TFs in each organism. In this intervening year, we expect to capture data for another 75-100 factors. The present project builds on the advances made by the groups in the initial phase and also combines the production pipelines to increase efficiency and to realize economies of scale. With these improvements, we will generate data sets for another 400 factors from each organism, which when combined with previous work will represent the bulk of all transcription factors in these key model organisms. For both organisms, the overall strategy tags transcription factor genes by fusion with an enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) sequence through recombineering of large insert clones, and introducing the tagged genes into the genome by transgenesis. ChlP-seq using a high quality anti-GFP antibody is performed on the developmental stage(s) with maximal GFP expression, as guided by available RNA-seq expression data. The aligned sequence reads are analyzed to identify candidate binding sites and likely target genes. We will prioritize TFs with human homologs to maximize the broader utility of the data. We will also perform RNAi of 125 TFs in each organism, followed by RNA-seq, to validate called peaks and their assigned target genes. Finally, we will integrate the information for the different data setsto construct regulatory networks implied by the TF binding site data. We will coordinate with ENCODE projects on human TFs, and our data will provide key in vivo and developmental regulatory information that will be essential to delineate both fundamentally conserved as well as human-specific properties of TFs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Insights from the study of the model organisms Drosophila and C. elegans provide the basis for broad understanding of fundamental processes of animal biology. Because many of their genes have clear relatives in humans, these studies have also led directly to improved understanding of human diseases and in some cases to therapies. Similarly, creating a comprehensive understanding of transcription factor binding sites and building regulatory networks in these key model organisms will create the foundation for understanding human regulatory networks both in health and disease.",

    "description": "The overall mission of this Mapping Center is to create and disseminate open access, comprehensive, high-quality, high-resolution reference maps of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) in the human and mouse genomes, at previously unattainable levels of cellular and anatomical definition. Regulatory DNA is actuated in an exceptionally state-specific manner;\u037e accordingly, achieving a comprehensive map of DHSs necessitates the interrogation of an expansive and finely partitioned range of cell and tissue samples. Progressive technical improvements and recent innovations have resulted in dramatic (>100x) decreases in requisite input biological sample quantities coupled with equally dramatic (>100x) increases in assay throughput, and corresponding decreases in the incremental cost of generating reference-quality DHS maps. These advances have in turn opened the possibility of systematically addressing all well-defined physiologically and disease-relevant anatomic and cellular compartments. Four major Specific Aims are targeted: (1) To create open access, comprehensive high-quality, high- resolution reference maps of human DNase I hypersensitive sites\u037e (2) To create and disseminate comprehensive high-quality, high-resolution reference maps of mouse DNase I hypersensitive sites\u037e (3) To maintain and disseminate reference indices of DNase I hypersensitive sites and footprints in the human and mouse genomes\u037e and (4) To enable large-scale intake of Consortium and Community samples for high-quality, high-throughput DHS mapping.",

Our proposed DAC team (Zhiping Weng, Mark Gerstein, Manolis Kellis, Roderic Guigo, Rafael Irizarry, X. Shirley Liu, Anshul Kundaje, and William Noble) has expertise across a wide range of fields including transcriptional regulation, epigenetics, evolution, genomics and proteomics, regulatory RNA, biophysics, and computational biology, where they are the leaders in machine learning, statistical genetics, networks, and gene annotation. These investigators also have a history of successfully working collaboratively in large consortia, particularly with other ENCODE groups. Their publication records demonstrate their synergistic approach to producing high-impact science and useful resources that benefit the broader biomedical communities. The proposed DAC will pursue the following four aims: Aim 1. Analyze and integrate data and metadata from a broad range of functional genomics projects; Aim 2. Serve as an informatics resource by supporting the activities of the ENCODE Analysis Working Group; Aim 3. Create high-quality Encyclopedias of DNA elements in the human and mouse genomes; Aim 4.

    "description": "Repetitive transposable elements (TEs) comprise over 50% of the human genome. While some investigators regard TEs as \u201cparasitic\u201d DNA, other studies suggest that TEs play a more constructive role in genome evolution by providing raw material for new biological functions. For example, TEs commonly harbor active cis-regulatory elements that are occasionally co-opted during evolution to wire new gene regulatory networks. While investigators now recognize the importance of TEs in gene regulation, TEs remain under-analyzed in high-throughput data because of methodological hurdles associated with their repetitive nature. Thus, the impact of TEs on the regulation of the human genome, both in normal development and disease, remains largely uncharacterized. We propose to develop novel computational methods to assess and clarify the impact of TEs in regulatory innovation using ENCODE data. In Specific Aim 1 we will develop new algorithms and statistical methods to predict active regulatory elements encoded by TEs from heterogeneous ENCODE data. If successful, we will generate a profile of TE-derived regulatory elements and their predicted targets across diverse cell/tissue types and developmental stages, revealing new gene regulatory networks wired by TEs. With these new methods we also intend to examine the extent of TE dysregulation in cancer cells and its transcriptional consequences. In Specific Aim 2 we will extend the models developed in Aim 1 to understand the role of TEs in shaping the 3D topology of the genome, which is intimately connected to genome function. We will investigate the role of TEs in partitioning the genome into chromosomal domains that orchestrate communication between cis-regulatory elements and their target genes. In particular, we will quantify the extent to which TEs drive conservation and divergence in genome topology across mammal species. In Specific Aim 3 we will take advantage of the repetitive nature of TEs to develop a novel statistical model that links sequence changes in different copies of TEs to epigenetic and functional differences. The numerous, but slightly different copies of a TE present in a single genome provide a unique opportunity to identify sequence variants that underlie epigenetic modification, which will further our understanding of how TEs become co-opted for host gene regulation. Finally, in Specific Aim 4, we will deploy our recently developed Repeat Element Browser as a web portal and downloadable application specifically tailored for investigators to analyze, visualize and explore data produced by ENCODE, others, and their own data in the context of TEs. The methods developed in this proposal will have a high impact on the utility of the data produced by ENCODE and will greatly expand our understanding of the contribution of TEs to non-coding regulatory elements in healthy tissues and disease.",

    "description": "A fundamental challenge in decoding the information stored in a genome is to describe the transcripts read from it and their structure. The nematode C. elegans offers an extraordinary opportunity among eukaryotes to accomplish this goal now. The small, compact genome is completely sequenced. The simple anatomy, fixed cell lineage and transparent body through the full life span make each and every cell available for observation and analysis at any time. Already more than 1,300 noncoding RNAs and 17,000 of the estimated 21,000 protein coding genes, along with 2,500 alternative splice forms, have been fully or at least partially defined experimentally. The present proposal seeks to complete the definition of the transcribed genome of C. elegans. We will do this by assembly of all the available experimental data with a variety of gene models to define accurately the extent of the known transcribed genome. From this base, we will extend our knowledge of the transcribed genome through systematic application of genome tiling arrays across various stages and cells of the life cycle, including targeted analysis of microRNAs. In turn we will integrate this new data along with any other new data from the community with the gene models and any new models that develop. We will attempt directed confirmation of unconfirmed gene models through RT-PCR and custom arrays, starting with the initial set of gene models and adding new data as it becomes available. We will also use mass spectrometry to distinguish protein coding transcripts from noncoding transcripts for small potential open reading frames. The result will be a set of transcripts that will approach completion for protein coding genes and their UTRs and alternative splice forms as well as non-coding RNAs. The experience gained with this modest genome should be of value in interpreting more complex genomes, such as human.",

    "description": "DNA replication is an essential cell cycle process required to duplicate the chromosomes each and every cell division. Very little is known about how replication is coordinated with other nuclear processes such as transcription and chromatin modification. Although recent genomic studies have demonstrated a correlation between time of DNA replication and transcriptional activity, with actively transcribed regions of the genome being replicated early, the underlying mechanism driving this correlation remains unclear. Only by systematically characterizing the replication dynamics of a metazoan genome in multiple cell types will we be in a position to understand the mechanisms by which these processes are coordinated to maintain genomic stability. We will use high-density genomic tiling-path arrays to characterize fully the Drosophila replication program in multiple cell lines and tissues. Specifically, we will determine the time of replication for all unique sequences in Drosophila genome, identify and map all functional origins of replication, and identify all sites of prereplicative complex (preRC, an essential multi-protein complex required for replication initiation) assembly. The high-resolution mapping of sites of preRC assembly will enable us to apply computational approaches (including comparative genomics) to identify potential sequence motifs that direct and regulate preRC function. Finally, we will also characterize the differential replication of polytene chromosomes in fully differentiated Drosophila tissues to identify genomic regions that are amplified or underreplicated. The differential replication of polytene chromosomes provides a unique opportunity to understand how developmental cues and chromosomal domains influence the replication program. In proliferating cells, duplication of the genome is a critical cell-cycle event, not only must the genome be copied accurately; it must also be copied exactly once. The regulation of origin selection and activation is essential to maintain genomic stability. The failure to completely replicate the genome or the inappropriate over-replication of select sequences may lead to tumorigenesis.",

    "description": "Since its inception in 2003, the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium has made remarkable progress towards the identification of all functional elements in the human genome. However, major limitations of the current catalog are that the vast majority of elements have not been functionally characterized, the impact of genetic variation on their function is poorly defined, the precise levels of activation or repression that they confer remain unmeasured, and the specific gene(s) that they regulate are not definitively known. To address these gaps, we will implement `in genome' massively parallel functional assays to characterize over 100,000 ENCODE-based candidate regulatory elements, to confirm and quantify their activities as well as to link many of them to their target genes. In a systematic comparison of episomal vs. genomic massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA), we show that episomal assays fail to accurately capture the full patterns of regulatory activity that are observed in the context of chromatin. We therefore focus exclusively on methods that test candidate regulatory elements in an integrated, `in genome' context. First, using lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assays, we will characterize at least 100,000 ENCODE-based regulatory elements for their promoter/enhancer activity while integrated into the genome (lentiMPRA; Aim 1a). Importantly, lentiMPRA can be carried out in almost every cell type and leverages ongoing developments in lentivirus technology. Early results will be used to iteratively develop models that make better selections for subsequent rounds of functional characterization. Second, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 and multiplex homology directed repair to integrate a subset of candidate enhancers to the 3' UTR of transcriptionally inactive genes, allowing us to further validate and characterize their ability to activate transcription in a natural genomic context (`in genome' STARR-seq; Aim 1b). Finally, we will implement a new paradigm involving CRISPR/Cas9-based multiplex genome editing followed by RNA-seq/ATAC-seq molecular profiling to characterize a genome-wide subset of candidate regulatory elements in their native genomic context for the functional consequences of mutations on them, while also determining the target gene(s) that they regulate (massively parallel genome editing; Aim 2). Although we will initially focus our efforts on K562 and HepG2 cells, we will also perform work in other cell lines as appropriate for the needs of the ENCODE Consortium, with 25% of our capacity dedicated to a common set of elements. Combined with the efforts of the other functional characterization centers, our work will provide unprecedented `in genome' validation and characterization of ENCODE-defined candidate regulatory elements, while also facilitating insights into our understanding of the basic biology of gene regulation and how regulatory variants contribute to human disease risk.",

Based on the empirically determined characteristics of the detected transcripts uncovered in this proposal, a classification system for transcribed protein coding and non-protein coding portions of the human transcriptome will be established. Our aims include first to generate a comprehensive set of subcellular compartment-specific long (>200 nucleotides, nts) and short (<200 nts) polyadenylated (polyA+) and non-polyadenylated (polyA-) RNA samples from each of the cell types studied. These RNA samples will be analyzed using: a) high density tiling arrays (5 nucleotides [nt] interrogation resolution for long and short RNAs), b) sequencing (pyrosequencing [454] and clonal single molecule sequencing for short RNAs [Solexa]), c) sequenced paired-end ditags (PETs) for 5' TSS and 3' termination locations for polyA+ transcripts and d) sequenced cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) tags for 5' TSS of polyA- RNAs. Characterization of full length subcellular compartment-specific transcripts will also be carried out using: 1) a combination of rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), RT-PCR and sequencing, 2) RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and 3) in situ immunohistochemistry. These characterization steps will provide additional information concerning the annotated and unannotated RNAs found to be associated with known functional, compartment-specific proteins and their localization in subcellular organelles of known function. The research and health-care community are well positioned to take advantage of a detailed catalog of classified transcribed regions in the human genome. For example, the identification of millions of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and the ability to genetically alter specific transcript expression by small inhibitory (si-) and micro (mi-) RNAs are highly useful for the molecular characterization of diseases associated with the transcribed regions. However, the utility of these and other genomic resources are dependent upon having a complete and high quality catalogue of transcribed regions.",

This includes identifying all the protein-coding loci with associated alternative variants, non-coding loci which have transcript evidence available in the public nucleotide database (NCBI/EMBL/DDBJ) and pseudogenes. To achieve this goal we will integrate computational approaches, including recent comparative methods, expert manual annotation, able to integrate literature information, and targeted experimental approaches. Based on the exhaustive experimental and computation investigation of our initial GENCODE annotation of the ENCODE regions we are confident that we can deliver a gene set with high specificity and sensitivity that will provide critical information to other biologists and other ENCODE groups. As part of this process we will label all apparent gene loci clearly, classifying them according to their likely current functional status, so users are informed where regions that appear gene like are most likely pseudogenes or where transcript evidence is most likely artefactual. There are a number of motivated groups working in the area of defining protein coding genes for the human genome. This proposal includes most such groups and coordinates with other key groups. Critically, all the groups bring extensive experience of data integration and evaluation, leading to the resolution of annotation discrepancies by multiple approaches. This gives us confidence that through this integrated project we will be able to eliminate many of the remaining uncertainties about the precise location of genes and their component exons and transcript structure in the human genome. Genome-wide, highly accurate transcript definition will be of enormous value to the myriad of researchers working on the human genome. It will both have large cost savings worldwide due to increased specificity of reagent design and provide a more complete view of human genes, in particular those associated with disease. From this foundation, more accurate descriptions of the genetic causes of disease can be discovered.",

    "description": "The developmental shifts that occur when cells respond to environmental stimuli are controlled in large part by gene expression programs involving thousands of genes. Transcription factors (TFs), chromatin modifying enzymes, and cis-acting DNA elements contribute to the networks that underlie such programs. The code that links these variables in such a way that the expression of a given gene can be predicted based on the presence of specific components has yet to be deciphered. A model for such a code will be constructed here based on genome-wide analysis of human dendritic cells (DCs) as they mature in response to pathogens. DCs are antigen-presenting cells that initiate and determine the quality and magnitude of the host immune response. Recent technical advances in stem cell biology, reverse-genetic tools for primary human cells, and genome-wide assessment of transcripts, local chromatin features and long-range chromatin interactions, will be exploited here to construct a model for the transcriptional regulatory network that underlies pathogen detection and maturation in human DCs. In Aim 1, DCs will be sampled in a time-course following stimulation with LPS. Stimulation-responsive genes will be identified by RNA-Seq. Chromatin features will be mapped using ChIP-Seq, high-resolution global DNA foot printing, and Hi-C. This systematic map of all responsive genes and the regulatory regions associated with them will be combined with known DNA-binding motifs to generate an initial model for the gene regulatory network. In Aim 2 sixty transcription factors that drive transcription within the first 2 hrs of LPS stimulation will be identified from the model in Aim 1. These factors will be knocked-down in hDCs and the effect on the LPS response will be assessed using RNA-Seq. This functional data for each TF will be complemented by measurement of protein-DNA interactions using ChIP- Seq; the later will exploit CRISPR technology to fuse a common epitope tag to endogenous coding sequences for these TFs. By pinpointing key transcription factors, their binding sites, and transcriptionally-responsive genes, this analysis will be used to refine the model for the gene regulatory network. In Aim 3, a subset of cis- acting regulatory regions important for controlling the hDC transcriptional response to LPS will be identified using features collected in the previous aims. Selected loci will be perturbed using CRISPR technology and effects on target gene expression will be examined. The effect on gene expression of allelic variants in relevant loci will be assessed, using published data as well as 300 human samples that will be genotyped using Pac- Bio. In conjunction, the variance in the higher-order chromatin conformation for 50 key regulatory loci across five individuals will be assessed by 5C. These data will be used to further refine our regulatory model. The result of this analysis will be a model that highlights the key transcription factors and cis-acting components that drive gene expression in LPS-stimulated human DCs. Our findings are expected to provide a more general method for identifying the genetic determinants of gene expression in primary mammalian cells.",

A critical part in delivering this set of functional elements is the integration of data from multiple sources. The ED AC proposal aims to provide this integration. As proscribed by the RFA for this proposal, the precise prioritization for the EDAC's work will be set by an external group, the Analysis Working Group (AWG). Based on previous experience, these analysis methods will require a variety of techniques. We expect to have to apply sophisticated statistical models to the integration of the data, in particular mitigating the problems of the extensive heterogeneity and correlation of variables on the human genome. We have statistical experts who can use the large size of the human genome, coupled with a limited number of sensible assumptions to produce statistical techniques which are robust to this considerable heterogeneity. We also expect to apply machine learning techniques to build integration methods combining datasets. These included Bayesian based inference methods and the robust computer science technique of Support Vector Machines. Each of these methods have performed well in the ENCODE pilot project and we expect them to be even more useful in the full ENCODE project. We will also provide quality assurance and summary metrics of genome-wide multiple alignments. This area has a number of complex statistical, algorithmic and engineering issues, which we will solve using state of the art techniques.

To do this, we will generate stable HeLa-S3 and GM 12878 cell lines expressing epitope-tagged RBPs and determine the sub cellular localization pattern of each RBP. These cells will be used to perform CLIP-Seq assays to define genome-wide, and at single-nucleotide resolution, the RNA sequence elements recognized by 250 RBPs. The RNA sequence elements identified will be validated using sequence-based in vitro binding assays. Furthermore, ChlP-Seq will be performed for all nuclear localized RBPs to determine the regions of the genome and chromatin that each RBP associates with. These binding assays will be supplemented with functional assays in RBP-depleted cells that will be critical for assigning functions to the identified binding sites. These assays include RNA-Seq of total cellular RNA and RNA purified from various cellular fractions, ribosomal footprint profiling, and Gro-Seq. Together, these assays will provide functional information regarding the roles of each RBP in splicing, cleavage and polyadenylation, RNA stability, RNA editing, translation, RNA localization, and transcription. Bioinformatic analysis will be performed, largely using software generated by our group, to quantitate all assays and to associate functions to the sequence elements identified in the binding assays. Together, these experiments will provide a comprehensive and in depth measure of the functions of approximately half of the human RBPs and the functional sequence elements that they interact with. This project will fill a major gap in the catalog of functional elements encoded in the human genome that are being characterized by the ENCODE consortium. The product of this project will be a unique and valuable community resource that will push the field forward in new and exciting ways and will almost certainly create new paradigms regarding the functions of RBPs and RNA-protein networks in human biology and disease.",

    "description": "Our primary goal is to comprehensively identify the functional elements of the Drosophila transcriptome, including the poly(A)- transcripts, all translated regions, and all RNA elements bound by proteins. In addition, we propose to elucidate the RNA sequences and binding proteins that regulate splicing, translation and stability of RNA. We plan to survey representative time points throughout development, a wide-variety of tissue types and well-characterized cell lines. We will produce a catalog of poly(A)- transcripts with single-base resolution and validate a subset of transcription start sites and termination sites using RLM-RACE. We will discover novel translated elements of mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs using ribosome profiling and validate a subset using a protein expression assay. We will comprehensively identify the RNAs bound by the complete set of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in Drosophila using affinity purification followed by high throughput sequencing (RIP-seq), prioritizing human homologs. RBPs recognize and bind to specific RNA sequences, and these interactions can regulate the stability, splicing, nuclear export, subcellular localizatin, and translatability of mRNAs. Concurrent with these studies, bioinformatic analyses will identify new poly(A)- transcripts, model their secondary structures, discover novel translated elements of mRNAs such as uORFs and identify long non-coding RNAs. For each RNA-binding protein (RBPs), we will identify bound transcripts using statistical measures of reproducibility, biologica replicates and relative enrichment. We also plan to identify binding-site motifs (PWMs) and develop the network of RNA-protein interactions. We will integrate the RNA-protein interaction map with the published Drosophila Protein Interaction Map. The scope of these studies is unprecedented and will provide the most comprehensive set of experimental evidence for post-transcriptional gene regulation in any organism. As a public resource, these studies are a prerequisite for understanding normal metabolism, growth and differentiation that will aid in understanding these processes in other organisms and in human health and disease.",

    "description": "Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays. We also plan to test 100 lower ranking sites to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our algorithms. We will also develop an oligo competition assay as a new approach to increase the throughput of experimental motif analysis for the rest of the genome. The data generated in this project will be the first systematic functional analysis of TF binding sites at base-pair resolution.",

    "description": "High-density microarrays and next-generation sequencing technologies, coupled with the availability of the annotated human genomic sequence, are opening a road toward a comprehensive mapping of molecular epigenetic patterns. It is anticipated that comprehensive mapping and study of epigenetic patterns both \"horizontally\" along the genomic sequence and \"vertically\" across multiple differentiation and developmental stages and physiological conditions, will provide insights into human development, physiology, and disease. This vision of epigenomics calls both for novel organizational models suitable for high-throughput data-driven science and for innovative networked cyberinfrastructure. This project aims to develop such networked cyberinfrastructure and employ it to integrate and coordinate data analyses and data pipelines involving designated Reference Epigenome Mapping Centers (REMCs), NCBI, and other participants. The infrastructure builds on the now well established Genboree system which was developed in the context of numerous genome projects and has most recently been employed to coordinate the pilot stage of The Cancer Genome Atlas Project. The infrastructure will provide both scalability for further integration of new epigenomic technologies with increasing data production throughputs and adaptability to accommodate an increasing diversity of experimental and computational methodologies. Using the software-as-a-service model, web services, and semantic web technologies, the infrastructure will help integrate and coordinate efforts of REMCs, NCBI, and an increasing number of collaborating institutions and multi-disciplinary groups in the field of epigenomics working across geographic locations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Epigenomics is the study of heritable or stable changes in human cells that are not coded in the genomic DNA. The role of epigenomic changes in diseases as diverse as obesity, autism, and cancer is coming to light. Importantly, because epigenomic phenomena are affected by nutrition and environment, including maternal nutrition during pregnancy, increased understanding of epigenomics may lead to better health through changes in human nutrition and behavior. To better understand epigenomic phenomena in human health and disease, the NIH Roadmap Initiative in Epigenomics proposes comprehensive mapping and study of epigenomic patterns in human tissues at different developmental stages and physiological conditions. High-density microarrays and next-generation sequencing technologies, coupled with the availability of the annotated human genomic sequence, are opening a road toward a comprehensive mapping of such patterns. The amount and diversity of data produced will be very large and will require an informatic infrastructure for proper analysis. Building on the established Genboree system for collaborative genomic research over the Internet, this project aims to develop such a networked infrastructure, and employ it to integrate and to coordinate data analyses and data pipelines involving designated Reference Epigenome Mapping Centers and other participants in the NIH Roadmap Initiative in Epigenomics.",

Transcription factor targets, chromatin modifications and modifying enzymes will be mapped across the genome using chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. This binding information will be validated and analyzed to ensure that it is of high quality and then compared to other genomic annotations. Our three aims are: 1) To establish a production facility for mapping targets of transcription factors. The pipeline will consist of five components: a) cell preparation, b) antibody validation and chromatin immunoprecipitation, c) DNA target analysis, d) target validation and e) sample tracking and databases. 2) To use the pipeline to map targets of 600 transcription factors, chromatin modifications and chromatin modifying enzymes in at least two major cell lines (HeLa S3 and HepG2), and targets of other factors in additional cell lines. 3) To maintain our results in a database and also make them accessible through public databases. We will interrelate our genomic annotations with those determined by other groups (particularly those from the ENCODE consortium), focusing on correlating patterns of transcription-factor binding and chromatin modifications with gene expression.

    "description": "The goal of this project is to functionally annotate genetic variants in post-transcriptional regulation of RNA expression, which extends and complements the current focus of ENCODE data analysis. Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in disease genomes or across population. The next great challenge is to identify causal variants and elucidate their potential function in biological and disease processes. To this end, research efforts have been directed to studying variants located in protein-coding, promoter, and splice site regions due to their apparent impacts on gene expression. However, many of the newly identified disease-associated variants reside in other non-coding regions, such as introns, that may confer regulatory function to the related gene. The mechanisms of these variants have been hard to decipher. It is expected that many of them may function at the post-transcriptional level, thus affecting mRNA expression. In human, a myriad of processes mediate RNA expression at the post-transcriptional stage, such as splicing, editing, polyadenylation and mRNA decay. Post-transcriptional regulation is extremely versatile, yet closely regulated, affecting most human genes. Despite the importance, how to accurately identify functional genetic variants in these processes remains a key question in the field. To address this question, the large collection of ENCODE expression and protein-binding data represent an invaluable resource. We will develop novel methodologies to make full use of the ENCODE and other publicly available data sets, complemented by further bioinformatic prediction and experimental validations. This work will allow a previously unattained level of understanding of genetic variants in post-transcriptional regulation of RNA expression and provide new means to tackle the imperative task of functional annotations of genetic variants.",

    "description": "The overarching goal of the proposed study is to functionally characterize a large number of candidate functional elements in the mammalian genome. The ENCODE projects have revealed millions of putative regulatory elements across more than one hundred cell types and tissues. While these maps have significantly expanded our knowledge of non-coding sequences, there are still large gaps between having descriptive maps of functional elements and understanding the biology of these elements underlying gene regulation. These include: (a) few candidate functional elements predicted by the ENCODE experiments are functionally validated; (b) Epigenomic studies have not given/revealed information on the target genes of candidate functional elements. Therefore, it is still a challenge to interpret the biological functions of non-coding DNA sequences. To address these issues, the objective of this UM1 application is to perform large scale functional characterization of candidate functional elements in their native chromatin context. We will first identify candidate regulatory elements utilizing ENCODE data and generate reporter tagged genes of interest in cell lines utilizing a high throughput, automated platform. Second, we will interrogate candidate functional elements in their native chromatin contexts utilizing two complementary high throughput CRIPSR/Cas9 mediated genome editing approaches. We anticipate these analyses will significantly advance our knowledge of the biological functions of candidate regulatory regions and gene regulation in mammalian cells.",

    "description": "Specific enhancers interact with promoters to specify the cellular pattern, timing, and levels of gene expression. Enhancers can reside up to megabases away from their target gene promoters and strongly activate transcription. Aim 1 will characterize active enhancer elements and their relationship to promoter elements in vivo in human K562 (a tier 1 ENCODE cell line) by testing a broad array of Transcription Regulatory Elements (TREs) for their enhancer activity using eSTARR-seq, our modified element-clone- compatible STARR-seq assay. This collection of TREs will be selected based on a variety of criteria established by ENCODE and others. Large numbers of selected TREs can be handled using our new Clone- seq method, and then tested for enhancer activity by eSTARR-seq. For the TREs that have significant enhancer activity, ~10,000 synthetic mutations will be generated that are designed to destroy distinct TF binding motifs found within each enhancer. We will generate mutant clones using our en masse Clone-seq2 method and examine their impact on enhancer activity using eSTARR-seq. These data will be used to understand the underlying molecular architecture and function of enhancers and promoters. Aim 2 generates K562 cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 that contain critical synthetic enhancer mutations identified in Aim 1. PRO- seq assays can then be used to measure with high sensitivity and resolution the transcription at the variant enhancers as well as all TREs and transcription units genome-wide. This will reveal the role of DNA sequence motifs within native enhancer loci in the regulatory crosstalk with distal gene promoters and enhancers. Circularized Chromosome Conformation Capture (4C) experiments with particular enhancers as the anchor site will provide an unbiased analysis of distal interactions, while targeted ChIP-qPCR experiments will test effects of these mutant enhancers on transcription factor binding and local histone marks at these genomic points of enhancer interaction. Thus, Aim 2 rigorously characterizes mutated enhancers from Aim 1 in their native chromatin environment. Aim 3 characterizes the de novo activation of enhancers, which are known to be triggered by the heat shock activation of HSF1, a master regulator. Because the sequence motif, HSE, to which HSF1 binds is well defined, targeted HSE mutations that cripple the enhancer activity will be made immediately using CRISPR at native loci and the effects on transcription genome-wide can be analyzed directly by PRO-seq. Additional critical motifs in these inducible enhancers will be identified in a less biased way by the more laborious, but high-throughput, eSTARR-seq approach described in Aim 1. Finally, tracking the kinetics with which the structural characteristics of these enhancers form in the minutes following heat shock relative to the induced transcriptional activity as measured by PRO-seq allows assessment of which characteristics (DNase I hypersensitivity, histone modifications, binding of HSF1 and other TFs, and eRNA production) correlate with functional transcription effects on distal promoters and other enhancers.",

The overriding focus of our production effort has been on data quality. Accordingly, samples will be rigorously screened in a pipeline fashion, with only a select set advancing to whole-genome data collection. To ensure the broadest possible coverage of both unique and non-unique genomic territories, we will employ a higher resolution, higher coverage sequencing strategy than the prior project period, significantly enhancing the information content of the data. This proposal integrates the UW-FHCRC Mouse ENCODE Center, which will be closely aligned with the human project to generate a comparative catalogue of regulatory DNA in carefully matched cells and tissues, providing an unparalleled resource. Since DNasel hypersensitive sites are generic markers of a broad spectrum of human cis-regulatory sequences, the utility of the catalogue will be greatly enhanced by the classification of DHSs into major functional categories including promoters, distal elements (enhancers, LCRs), and insulators. We plan to systematically connect distal DHSs with their cognate promoters and to perform in vivo validation of these connections using nuclease-mediated knockouts of distal DHSs in somatic cells.",

This is because\u2014in contrast to protein-coding sequences\u2014the \u201crules\u201d that govern links from genome sequence to regulatory function are fuzzy, complex, and highly context-specific. Our limited understanding of regulatory regions presents a fundamental challenge for the identification and interpretation of disease variation, especially in the context of personal genome interpretation. Work from ENCODE and other groups has started to close this gap through experimental work, including high-resolution maps of regulatory sites in a variety of cell types, and modeling of the cell-type specific mappings from genome sequence to regulatory function. In this project we will develop a suite of new tools that uses these diverse new data sets to tackle these problems. We will implement and apply powerful new machine learning methods (based on deep learning) to interpret the genomic, context-specific encoding of regulatory information, and to identify genetic variants that impact the encoded information. We will build models using data from a variety of sources including ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GTEx, regulatory variation in the HapMap cell lines, as well as from disease cohorts. Validation experiments will be performed using a new high-complexity CRISPR/Cas9 system developed by our team. We will develop software tools and analytical results that can be widely used for genome interpretation, especially in analysis of personal genomes.

    "description": "Genetic discoveries from genome-wide association studies have led to important insights on human disease mechanisms. In particular, disease-associated variants are enriched in regions of the genome that are active in gene regulation. However, most of these analyses have focused on individual variants with the strongest evidence of association, and on broadly defined functional annotations, which provide limited scope for understanding disease mechanisms. In this proposal we analyze a broader set of genome-wide variants, in conjunction with functionally specialized annotations with potential mechanistic interpretations, such as context-specific regulatory elements or binding sites for specific transcription factors. We utilize methods that ascribe heritability to specific segments of the genome, leveraging polygenic signals distributed across the entire genome instead of a limited number of known genetic associations. These methods can pinpoint disease heritability to smaller and more specific subsets of the genome defined by precise context-specific functional annotations. In addition to highlighting specific mechanisms of disease, localizing to precise annotations will offer the ability to identify causal variants. We will take advantage of large databases of genetic data, in addition to a vast array of functional genomics data from ENCODE and other consortia. Specifically, we will (1) develop new statistical methods to partition disease heritability across functional categories, (2) build new annotations enriched for disease heritability from existing functional data sets, and (3) develop new computational methods to integrate ATAC-seq data with ENCODE data.

    "description": "Systematic efforts led by the ENCODE project are underway to characterize all functional DNA elements in the human genome. A growing amount of data generated by ourselves and others has shown that a large portion of the putative regulatory elements are localized far away from gene coding regions. This observation cannot be explained by a simple linear relationship of locations along the genome, and we are unable to address non-linear interactions between functional DNA elements using current technologies. Our goal is to develop an unbiased, whole genome approach for the identification of chromatin interactions involved in transcriptional regulation and other structural and functional roles in the genome. The principal concept of our approach is to use a specially designed DNA oligonucleotide sequence to link different DNA fragments that are non-linearly related in the genome but brought together in close spatial proximity by protein factors in vivo, and extract paired end ditag sequences from the ligated DNA fragments based on the features of the DNA linker. This is followed by mapping the tags to the reference genome sequence, hence revealing the relationship between the paired DNA fragments. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1. To develop an unbiased, whole genome approach for the characterization of long-range chromatin interactions involved in transcription regulation. We developed a prototype protocol for CIA-PET analysis that can extract ditags from the linker-ligated DNA fragments of non-linearly related DNA interactions in S. pombe cells. We will further optimize this methodology and streamline the entire process of library construction, sequencing, and data analysis. In addition, we will rigorously validate the CIA-PET data using a variety of available low-throughput technologies. 2. To adapt CIA-PET technology to mammalian genomes for the identification of long range chromatin interactions involved in transcription regulation. We plan to further improve the specificity of CIA-PET and increase its capacity to suit the need for whole genome analysis in mammalian genomes. We will validate and demonstrate the utility of CIA-PET method in 3 biological systems: a) Chromatin interactions between hemoglobin genes and regulatory elements in mouse erythroid cells. b) Tertiary networks of transcription regulation mediated by Nanog and Oct4 in mouse embryonic stem cells. c) Estrogen receptor mediated chromatin interactions in human breast cancer cells. This project will provide unprecedented insight into the mechanisms of transcription regulations allowing us to better understand how cancer cells develop and how stem cells retain pluripotency.",

    "description": "Project Summary The proposed project aims to fundamentally advance the ENCODE Consortium's catalog of functional sequence elements in the human genome. ENCODE has already established a seminal resource that is enabling human biology, genetics and disease research. However, progress towards the Consortium's goal of identifying all functional genomic elements has been constrained by modest assay throughput and by the fact that functional elements tend to be exquisitely context-specific, only declaring themselves in specific developmental intervals, in specific disease settings, or in specific cell types obscured by tissue heterogeneity. To overcome these limitations and hasten progress towards ENCODE goals, the proposed project will purify highly specialized cell types from normal human tissues and blood, from tumors and other disease specimens, and from laboratory 'organoid' models that faithfully recapitulate developing brain, kidney or gut. These purified cell types will be applied to a multiplexed pipeline capable of acquiring genome-wide chromatin state maps with unprecedented throughput and low cost. Thousands of maps reflecting different chromatin modifications in different cell types will be integrated to derive a comprehensive set of sequence elements in the human genome, annotated by their predicted functions and cell type-specificities. The project will bring together a diverse team of experts in human biology and development, chromatin biology, genomics, and production research. This scientific team will coordinate closely with other Data Production, Coordination, Analysis and Functional Characterization Centers in the Encode Consortium to assemble a common catalog of the locations and cell type-specific functions of regulatory elements in the human genome. These annotations, and all primary data collected in the project, will be made freely available to the scientific community, with the goal to catalyze biomedical research and advance genomic medicine.",

    "description": "The overall aim of this research proposal is to apply functional methodology (initially developed at UW and adapted to high throughput by Regulome Corporation) for quantitative chromatin profiling to delineate the functional DNA elements across 30 megabases of human genome sequence selected by the ENCODE working group (the 'ENCODE regions'). First we will produce a quantitative chromatin profile of the ENCODE regions in a human lymphoblastoid cell line. This profile will enable precise localization of all major Dnasel-hypersensitive sites ('HSs' hereafter). Quantification of sequence-specific Dnasel sensitivity will be accomplished through application of a novel, tested high-throughput quantitative real-time PCR assay ('Hypersensitivity qPCR' or 'HSqPCR'). A specialized primer set that spans the ENCODE regions at high resolution will be designed and synthesized. This primer set will be employed in all the experiments. Second, we will produce quantitative chromatin profiles of the ENCODE regions in 3 additional cell types derived from the 3 major embryonic lineages (endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm). These profiles will enable localization of all major HSs present in each tissue type. The profiles, in combination with that of lymphoid cells, will further enable identification of tissue or lineage-restricted HSs and also of sites present in multiple lineages. Third, we will perform confirmatory validation experiments on identified HSs using high-resolution hypersensitivity Southerns. Hypersensitivity Southerns represent an extensively applied 'gold-standard' methodology for identification of HSs. 250 sites per year will be selected from those identified with the high throughput method and validated with this independent methodology. Fourth, the quantitative chromatin profiles produced will be subjected to detailed computational analysis with the aim of determining the correspondence between HSs and evolutionarily-conserved non-coding sequences. Parallel analyses will focus on identification of DNA sequence motifs associated with tissue-specific, lineage-specific, or multilineage HSs. Algorithms for identification and classification of HSs in the human genome will be developed and tested. The performance of selected published algorithms for identification of active regulatory sequences will also be evaluated. It is expected that this research effort will result in the identification of the majority (if not all) of the regulatory elements of the ENCODE regions, and will provide information on the feasibility of the application of this functional approach to the identification of all regulatory elements of the human genome.",

    "description": "The generation of complete or nearly complete eukaryotic genome sequences has produced an explosion of insights into the coding potential and evolution of genomes. However, we have less information about how key processes involving DMA are regulated, including transcription, replication, repair, and chromosome segregation. DMA sequence alone cannot be expected to reveal the mechanisms involved in genome regulation and inheritance, because these processes do not act on 'naked' DMA. In the context of the cell, DMA is packaged as chromatin, whose composition and organization regulate the accessibility and function of DMA sequences. Chromatin displays increasingly complex levels of organization and composition, starting with the basic nucleosome unit and progressing through higher order structures. Chromatin organization is critical for utilizing information stored in the genome; failure to accurately target or maintain chromosomal proteins and chromatin components results in aberrant patterns of gene expression and chromosome behavior, and is associated with many human diseases, most notably cancer. We propose to participate in the MODENCODE project by determining the locations of 125 chromosomal proteins and histone modifications across the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The proteins and modifications under study are involved in basic chromosomal functions such as DNA replication, gene expression, gene silencing, and inheritance. We will perform Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) with antibodies obtained commercially and generated and validated by this project, isolate and label the precipitated DNA, and apply the probes to genomic tiling arrays. Data generated by scanning the hybridized arrays will be analyzed by statistical methods, and the array data will be validated by independent analyses in cells and animals. We will initially assay localizations using chromatin from three cell lines and two embryonic stages, and will then extend the analysis of a subset of proteins to four additional animal tissues/stages. We will then perform a variety of comparisons between protein 'landscape' data sets, including analyses of combinatorial patterns of modifications and chromosomal proteins, tissue-specific differences, and interactions among proteins involved in the same epigenetic pathways. Finally, all validated data and analyses will be made available to members of the ENCODE project and scientific community. Successful completion of this project will provide basic information about the distributions of chromatin components across the Drosophila genome sequence, which will serve as a foundation for future functional studies. In addition, the data and analysis are highly likely to provide information critical to understanding the roles of chromatin in human cells and diseases.",

    "description": "Abnormal temporal control of replication is observed in many diseases but causal linkages are unknown. This gap will remain incomprehensible until the mechanisms regulating replication timing during normal development are understood. The long-term goal is to understand the relationship of replication timing to cellular epigenetic states and disease. The immediate goal is to identify cis-acting DNA/chromatin elements that regulate changes in replication timing during differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Mouse ESCs are an ideal experimental system due to the availability of chromosome engineering tools, directed cell differentiation systems, and comprehensive genome-wide maps of replication timing and transcription. These maps have identified the molecular coordinates of programmed changes in replication timing that occur in 400-800kb units termed \"replication domains\". The central hypothesis is that discrete identifiable chromatin or DNA sequence features dictate the boundaries of replication domains and the developmentally induced changes in their replication time. The rationale for this proposal is that identifying DNA/chromatin elements regulating replication timing is the essential next step in elucidating mechanisms regulating replication timing and its relationship to disease. Aim1 will test the hypothesis that replication domains are fundamental units of chromosome structure and function that can be transferred to an ectopic location. Large pieces of cloned genomic DNA from a developmentally regulated replication domain will be introduced into a region of constitutive replication timing. Repli- cation timing of the insert and flanking DNA will be monitored during differentiation to identify the minimal sequences constituting a unit of regulation. Aim2 will distinguish between models in which specific boundary elements punctuate temporally distinct domains vs. models of boundaries as passively replicated chromatin between actively programmed domains. Nested deletions will be engineered in developmentally controlled replication timing transition regions and the effects of deletions on the regulation of replication timing will be determined. Aim3 will test the hypothesis that transcription within a silent late replicating domain initiates a switch to early replication. Promoter and regulatory elements controlling transcription within a developmentally regulated replication domain will be deleted, replaced with an inducible promoter, and the effects of such manipulations on the regulation of replication timing will be analyzed. Studies described here will identify cis-acting elements regulating the developmental control of replication timing. This contribution is significant because identifying regulatory elements of replication timing control is a pre-requisite to understanding the role of replication timing in chromosome-based diseases. The work proposed here is innovative in that it proposes a novel combination of chromosome engineering and directed embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation to address the mechanisms eliciting developmentally programmed changes in replication timing.",
